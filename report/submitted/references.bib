  title = {{EUCLIA}{\textemdash}Exploring the {UV}/Optical Continuum Lag in Active Galactic Nuclei. I. A Model without Light Echoing},
  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {The tight interband correlation and the lag–wavelength relation among UV/optical continua of active galactic nuclei have been firmly established. They are usually understood within the widespread reprocessing scenario; however, the implied interband lags are generally too small. Furthermore, it is challenged by new evidence, such as that the X-ray reprocessing yields too much high-frequency UV/optical variation and that it fails to reproduce the observed timescale-dependent color variations among the Swift light curves of NGC 5548. In a different manner, we demonstrate that an upgraded inhomogeneous accretion disk model, whose local independent temperature fluctuations are subject to a speculated common large-scale temperature fluctuation, can intrinsically generate the tight interband correlation and lag across the UV/optical and be in nice agreement with several observational properties of NGC 5548, including the timescale-dependent color variation. The emergent lag is a result of the differential regression capability of local temperature fluctuations when responding to the large-scale fluctuation. An average speed of propagations as large as ≳15% of the speed of light may be required by this common fluctuation. Several potential physical mechanisms for such propagations are discussed. Our interesting phenomenological scenario may shed new light on comprehending the UV/optical continuum variations of active galactic nuclei.}

  abstract = {The masses of supermassive black holes correlate almost perfectly with the velocity dispersions of their host bulges, Mbh ∝ σα, where α = 4.8 ± 0.5. The relation is much tighter than the relation between Mbh and bulge luminosity, with a scatter no larger than expected on the basis of measurement error alone. Black hole masses recently estimated by Magorrian et al. lie systematically above the Mbh-σ relation defined by more accurate mass estimates, some by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The tightness of the Mbh-σ relation implies a strong link between black hole formation and the properties of the stellar bulge.}

  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {We investigate the optical variability of 7658 quasars from SDSS Stripe 82. Taking advantage of a larger sample and relatively more data points for each quasar, we estimate variability amplitudes and divide the sample into small bins of redshift, rest-frame wavelength, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and bolometric luminosity, respectively, to investigate the relationships between variability and these parameters. An anti-correlation between variability and rest-frame wavelength is found. The variability amplitude of radio-quiet quasars shows almost no cosmological evolution, but that of radio-loud ones may weakly anti-correlate with redshift. In addition, variability increases as either luminosity or Eddington ratio decreases. However, the relationship between variability and black hole mass is uncertain; it is negative when the influence of Eddington ratio is excluded, but positive when the influence of luminosity is excluded. The intrinsic distribution of variability amplitudes for radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars are different. Both radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars exhibit a bluer-when-brighter chromatism. Assuming that quasar variability is caused by variations of accretion rate, the Shakura-Sunyaev disk model can reproduce the tendencies of observed correlations between variability and rest-frame wavelength, luminosity as well as Eddington ratio, supporting that changes of accretion rate play an important role in producing the observed optical variability. However, the predicted positive correlation between variability and black hole mass seems to be inconsistent with the observed negative correlation between them in small bins of Eddington ratio, which suggests that other physical mechanisms may still need to be considered in modifying the simple accretion disk model.}

  abstract = {It is known that some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) transit from Type 1 to Type 2 or vice versa. There are two explanations for the so-called changing-look AGNs: one is the dramatic change of the obscuration along the line of sight, and the other is the variation of accretion rate. In this Letter, we report the detection of large amplitude variations in the mid-infrared luminosity during the transitions in 10 changing-look AGNs using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and newly released Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation data. The mid-infrared light curves of 10 objects echo the variability in the optical band with a time lag expected for dust reprocessing. The large variability amplitude is inconsistent with the scenario of varying obscuration, rather it supports the scheme of dramatic change in the accretion rate.}

  title = {{PS}16dtm: A Tidal Disruption Event in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy},
  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {We present observations of PS16dtm (also known as SN 2016ezh), a luminous transient that occurred at the nucleus of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy hosting a 106 M
⊙ black hole. The light curve shows that PS16dtm exhibited a plateau phase for ∼100 days, during which it showed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of  K, and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The spectra exhibit multicomponent hydrogen emission lines and strong Fe ii emission, show little time evolution, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being distinct from those of Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn). Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the X-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of its host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity associated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with an SN origin or known forms of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Therefore, we argue that PS16dtm is a tidal disruption event (TDE) in which the accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and excitation of the preexisting broad-line region, while obscuring the X-ray-emitting region of the preexisting AGN disk. We predict that PS16dtm will remain bright for years and that the X-ray emission will reappear on a similar timescale as the accretion rate declines. Placing PS16dtm in the context of other TDEs, we find that TDEs in AGN galaxies are more efficient and reach Eddington luminosities, likely due to interaction of the stellar debris with the preexisting accretion disk.}

  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {We have collected near-infrared to X-ray data of 20 multi-epoch heavily reddened SDSS quasars to investigate the physical mechanism of reddening. Of these, J2317+0005 is found to be a UV cutoff quasar. Its continuum, which usually appears normal, decreases by a factor 3.5 at 3000 Å, compared to its more typical bright state during an interval of 23 days. During this sudden continuum cut-off the broad emission line fluxes do not change, perhaps due to the large size of the broad-line region (BLR), r  23/(1+z) days. The UV continuum may have suffered a dramatic drop out. However, there are some difficulties with this explanation. Another possibility is that the intrinsic continuum did not change but was temporarily blocked out, at least toward our line of sight. As indicated by X-ray observations, the continuum rapidly recovers after 42 days. A comparison of the bright state and dim states would imply an eclipse by a dusty cloud with a reddening curve having a remarkably sharp rise shortward of 3500 Å. Under the assumption of being eclipsed by a Keplerian dusty cloud, we characterized the cloud size with our observations, however, which is a little smaller than the 3000 Å continuum-emitting size inferred from accretion disk models. Therefore, we speculate that this is due to a rapid outflow or inflow with a dusty cloud passing through our line of sight to the center.}

  abstract = {Over three quarters in 2010-2011, Kepler monitored optical emission from four active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with ∼30 minute sampling, >90% duty cycle, and ≲0.1% repeatability. These data determined the AGN optical fluctuation power spectral density (PSD) functions over a wide range in temporal frequency. Fits to these PSDs yielded power-law slopes of –2.6 to –3.3, much steeper than typically seen in the X-rays. We find evidence that individual AGNs exhibit intrinsically different PSD slopes. The steep PSD fits are a challenge to recent AGN variability models but seem consistent with first-order magnetorotational instability theoretical calculations of accretion disk fluctuations.}

The argument is based on the time lag between an AGN central engine switching on and becoming visible in X-rays, and the time the AGN then requires to photoionize a large fraction of the host galaxy. Based on the typical light travel time across massive galaxies, and the observed fraction of X-ray-selected AGN without AGN-photoionized narrow lines, we estimate that the AGN phase typically lasts ∼105 yr. This lifetime is short compared to the total growth time of 107–109 yr estimated from e.g. the Soltan argument and implies that black holes grow via many such short bursts and that AGN therefore ‘flicker’ on and off. We discuss some consequences of this flickering behaviour for AGN feedback and the analogy of X-ray binaries and AGN lifecycles.}",

  title={The High-redshift Quasar Luminosity Function from Multi-epoch Imaging Surveys},

  abstract={Upcoming time-domain imaging surveys such as the LSST will detect over a million high-redshift z > 4 quasars, making complete spectroscopic followup unfeasible. Statistical estimates such as luminosity functions and clustering measurements will require purely photometric methods for classifying quasars, estimating redshifts and estimating selection functions. We validate these methods and constrain the optical, type I quasar luminosity function (QLF) at 3.75 < z < 4.5 for −27.5 < M_1450 < −23.5. This thesis presents the first variability-selected QLF measurement at high redshift (z > 3.75) and constraint on the characteristic luminosity (M* = −26.7) from a single, uniformly-selected survey at z ~ 4. We used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) repeated imaging of the 275 sq. deg. equatorial region of the sky (−50 < R.A. < +60; −1.26 < Dec. < +1.26), known as Stripe 82, to select a statistical sample of z ~ 4 quasars. We extracted 40 million lightcurves from the imaging using forced photometry on all u, g, r, i, z epochs at the positions of sources detected on a deep i-band co-add. We developed a classification method based on photometric information alone (colors and variability metrics derived from these new multi-band lightcurves), which we validated with a spectroscopically complete 55 sq. deg. sub-region augmented with 102 new spectroscopic observations of quasars at z > 3.4 with i < 22.5. We demonstrate that selection functions for ensemble classifiers can be estimated by building generative models of empirical distributions of quasars previously selected with a diverse set of selection criteria. The z ~ 4 QLF contributes to our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and cosmic reionization of both H I and He II which likely began at z ~ 4 as a result of hard UV emissivity from quasars. The resulting QLF measurement is consistent with the previous lower number densities reported from deep, narrow-field surveys (COSMOS); it is not consistent with higher number densities reported from the NDWFS-DLS and CANDELS GOODS-S fields. In the context of recent 2.2 < z < 5 estimates from SDSS-III BOSS and Stripe 82, it indicates that the QLF evolves in both luminosity and density: the characteristic luminosity increases and density decreases log-linearly from z = 2.2-->5. It predicts that quasars contribute 100% of the ionizing emissivity needed to balance hydrogen recombinations at z ~ 4. Given that at z ∼ 6 hydrogen recombines faster and quasars are less abundant, this result suggests that quasars contributed a negligible fraction of UV photons to H I reionization. Finally, we find that the number of quasars at z ~ 4 is sufficient to ionize He II by z ~ 3, consistent with independent observations of the He II Lyman-alpha forest and temperature of the intergalactic medium.}

Observations performed with Suzaku, XMM–Newton and Swift allowed us to detect a dramatic change in the curvature of the 2–10 keV spectrum, revealing a significant variation of the absorbing column density along the line of sight (from ∼ 1 × 1024 cm−2 to ∼ 1 × 1023 cm−2). Consequently, we propose this source as a new member of the class of ‘changing look’ active galactic nuclei (AGN), i.e. AGN that have been observed both in Compton thin (NH= 1023  cm−2) and reflection-dominated states (Compton thick, NH \\&gt; 1024  cm−2). Due to the quite long time lag (six months) between the Suzaku and XMM–Newton observations, we cannot infer the possible location of the obscuring material causing the observed variability. In the 6–7 keV range, the XMM–Newton observation also shows a clear signature of the presence of an ionized absorber. Since this feature is not detected during the Suzaku observation (despite its detectability), the simplest interpretation is that the ionized absorber is also variable; its location is estimated to be within ∼ 10−3 pc from the central black hole, probably much closer in than the rather neutral absorber.}",

  abstract = {The well-known bluer-when-brighter trend observed in quasar variability is a signature of the complex processes in the accretion disk and can be a probe of the quasar variability mechanism. Using a sample of 604 variable quasars with repeat spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-I/II (SDSS), we construct difference spectra to investigate the physical causes of this bluer-when-brighter trend. The continuum of our composite difference spectrum is well fit by a power law, with a spectral index in excellent agreement with previous results. We measure the spectral variability relative to the underlying spectra of the quasars, which is independent of any extinction, and compare to model predictions. We show that our SDSS spectral variability results cannot be produced by global accretion rate fluctuations in a thin disk alone. However, we find that a simple model of an inhomogeneous disk with localized temperature fluctuations will produce power-law spectral variability over optical wavelengths. We show that the inhomogeneous disk will provide good fits to our observed spectral variability if the disk has large temperature fluctuations in many independently varying zones, in excellent agreement with independent constraints from quasar microlensing disk sizes, their strong UV spectral continuum, and single-band variability amplitudes. Our results provide an independent constraint on quasar variability models and add to the mounting evidence that quasar accretion disks have large localized temperature fluctuations.}

ABSTRACT={The last 25 years saw a major step forward in the analysis of optical and UV spectroscopic data
of large quasar samples. Multivariate statistical approaches have led to the definition of systematic
trends in observational properties that are the basis of physical and dynamical modeling of quasar
structure. We discuss the empirical correlates of the so-called “main sequence” associated with
the quasar Eigenvector 1, its governing physical parameters and several implications on our
view of the quasar structure, as well as some luminosity effects associated with the virialized
component of the line emitting regions. We also briefly discuss quasars in a segment of the
main sequence that includes the strongest FeII emitters. These sources show a small dispersion
around a well-defined Eddington ratio value, a property which makes them potential Eddington
standard candles.}

  abstract = {We present a complete analysis of the hard X-ray (2-10 keV) properties of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365, based on a 60 ks XMM-Newton observation performed in 2004 January. The two main results are as follows. (1) We detect an obscuring cloud with NH
             ∼ 3.5 × 1023 cm–2 crossing the line of sight in ∼25 ks. This implies a dimension of the X-ray source not larger than a few 1013 cm and a distance of the obscuring cloud of the order of 1016 cm. Adopting the black hole mass M
            BH estimated from the M
            BH-velocity dispersion relation, the source size is D
            S < 20RG
             and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds are R ∼ 3000-10, 000RG
             and n ∼ 1010 cm–3, i.e., typical values for broad-line region clouds. (2) An iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detected with high statistical significance. A time-integrated fit of the line+continuum reflection components suggests a high iron abundance (approximately three times solar) and an origin of these components in the inner part (within ∼10RG
            ) of the accretion disk, in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of the absorption variability.}

  abstract = {We report an identification of SDSS J141324+530527.0 (SBS 1411+533) at z = 0.456344 as a new “changing-look” quasar with a “turn-on” spectral type transition from Type-1.9/2 to Type-1 within a rest-frame timescale of 1–10 yr by a comparison of our new spectroscopic observation and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archive database. The SDSS DR7 spectrum taken in 2003 is dominated by a starlight emission from host galaxy redward of the Balmer limit, and has a non-detectable broad Hβ line. The new spectrum taken by us on 2017 June 1 and the SDSS DR14 spectrum taken on 2017 May 29 indicate that the object has a typical quasar spectrum with a blue continuum and strong Balmer broad emission lines. In addition, an intermediate spectral type can be identified in the SDSS DR13 spectrum taken in 2015. The invariability of the line wing of Mg ii
λ2800 emission and timescale argument (the invariability of [O iii]λ5007 line blue asymmetry) suggests that a variation of obscuration (an accelerating outflow) is not a favorable scenario. The timescale argument allows us to believe the type transition is possibly caused by either a viscous radial inflow or a disk instability around a  black hole.}

  abstract={In area and depth, the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3 π survey is unique among many-epoch, multi-band surveys and has enormous potential for the all-sky identification of variable sources. PS1 has observed the sky typically seven times in each of its five bands ( grizy ) over 3.5 years, but unlike SDSS, not simultaneously across the bands. Here we develop a new approach for quantifying statistical properties of non-simultaneous, sparse, multi-color light curves through light curve structure functions, effectively turning PS1 into a ∼35-epoch survey. We use this approach to estimate variability amplitudes and timescales ( ω r , τ ) for all point sources brighter than r P1 = 21.5 mag in the survey. With PS1 data on SDSS Stripe 82 as “ground truth,” we use a Random Forest Classifier to identify QSOs and RR Lyrae based on their variability and their mean PS1 and WISE colors. We find that, aside from the Galactic plane, QSO and RR Lyrae samples of purity ∼75% and completeness ∼92% can be selected. On this basis we have identified a sample of ∼1,000,000 QSO candidates, as well as an unprecedentedly large and deep sample of ∼150,000 RR Lyrae candidates with distances from ∼10 to ∼120 kpc. Within the Draco dwarf spheroidal, we demonstrate a distance precision of 6% for RR Lyrae candidates. We provide a catalog of all likely variable point sources and likely QSOs in PS1, a total of 25.8 × 10 6 sources.}

  title = {On the {UV}/Optical Variation in {NGC} 5548: New Evidence Against the Reprocessing Diagram},
  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {The reprocessing scenario is widely adopted in literature to explain the observed tight inter-band correlation and short lags in the UV/optical variations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this work we look into the color variability of the famous Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 with high-quality Swift multi-band UV/optical light curves. We find the color variation of NGC 5548 is clearly timescale-dependent, in a way that it is more prominent on shorter timescales. This is similar to that previously detected in quasar samples, but for the first time in an individual AGN. We show that while a reprocessing model with strict assumptions on the driving source and the disk size can apparently match the observed light curves and inter-band lags, it fails to reproduce the observed timescale dependency in the color variation. Such discrepancy raises a severe challenge to, and can hardly be reconciled under the widely accepted reprocessing diagram. It also demonstrates that the timescale dependency of the color variation is uniquely powerful in probing the physics behind AGN UV/optical variations.}

	Abstract = {We model the time variability of ~9000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 as a damped random walk (DRW). Using 2.7 million photometric measurements collected over 10 yr, we confirm the results of Kelly et al. and Koz{\l}owski et al. that this model can explain quasar light curves at an impressive fidelity level (0.01-0.02 mag). The DRW model provides a simple, fast (O( N ) for N data points), and powerful statistical description of quasar light curves by a characteristic timescale (Ï) and an asymptotic rms variability on long timescales (SF â ). We searched for correlations between these two variability parameters and physical parameters such as luminosity and black hole mass, and rest-frame wavelength. Our analysis shows SF â to increase with decreasing luminosity and rest-frame wavelength as observed previously, and without a correlation with redshift. We find a correlation between SF â and black hole mass with a power-law index of 0.18 $\pm$ 0.03, independent of the anti-correlation with luminosity. We find that Ï increases with increasing wavelength with a power-law index of 0.17, remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity, and increases with increasing black hole mass with a power-law index of 0.21 $\pm$ 0.07. The amplitude of variability is anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio, which suggests a scenario where optical fluctuations are tied to variations in the accretion rate. However, we find an additional dependence on luminosity and/or black hole mass that cannot be explained by the trend with Eddington ratio. The radio-loudest quasars have systematically larger variability amplitudes by about 30%, when corrected for the other observed trends, while the distribution of their characteristic timescale is indistinguishable from that of the full sample. We do not detect any statistically robust differences in the characteristic timescale and variability amplitude between the full sample and the small subsample of quasars detected by ROSAT . Our results provide a simple quantitative framework for generating mock quasar light curves, such as currently used in LSST image simulations.},

	Abstract = {We develop a method for separating quasars from other variable point sources using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 light-curve data for ~ 10,000 variable objects. To statistically describe quasar variability, we use a damped random walk model parametrized by a damping timescale, Ï, and an asymptotic amplitude (structure function), SF â . With the aid of an SDSS spectroscopically confirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typical extragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples with reasonable purity (or efficiency, E ). Compared to a selection method based solely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the Ï information boosts E from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample (98%) even in the absence of color information. For a completeness of C = 90%, E is boosted from 80% to 85%. Conversely, C improves from 90% to 97% while maintaining E = 80% when imposing a lower limit on Ï. With the aid of color selection, the purity can be further boosted to 96%, with C = 93%. Hence, selection methods based on variability will play an important role in the selection of quasars with data provided by upcoming large sky surveys, such as Pan-STARRS and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). For a typical (simulated) LSST cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag (achieved at i ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {â} 22), C is expected to be 88% for a simple sample selection criterion of Ï>100 days. In summary, given an adequate survey cadence, photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection for separating quasars from stars.},

	Abstract = {We provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of the optical continuum variability of quasars. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has obtained repeated imaging in five UV-to-IR photometric bands for 33,881 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. About 10,000 quasars have an average of 60 observations in each band obtained over a decade along Stripe 82 (S82), whereas the remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. The observed time lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasar variability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-frame wavelengths from 1000 {\AA} to 6000 {\AA}. We publicly release a user-friendly catalog of quasars from the SDSS Data Release 7 that have been observed at least twice in SDSS or once in both SDSS and the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and we use it to analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. Based on a damped random walk (DRW) model defined by a characteristic timescale and an asymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black hole mass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in S82, we can fully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-S82 quasars such as the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. All available data are consistent with the DRW model as a viable description of the optical continuum variability of quasars on timescales of ~5-2000 days in the rest frame. We use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination in transient surveys such as those from the Palomar Transient Factory and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

  abstract = {The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) is a general purpose virtual X-ray astrophysics facility that provides access to a carefully selected set of generally useful quantities for individual X-ray sources, and is designed to satisfy the needs of a broad-based group of scientists, including those who may be less familiar with astronomical data analysis in the X-ray regime. The first release of the CSC includes information about 94,676 distinct X-ray sources detected in a subset of public Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer imaging observations from roughly the first eight years of the Chandra mission. This release of the catalog includes point and compact sources with observed spatial extents ≲30″. The catalog (1) provides access to the best estimates of the X-ray source properties for detected sources, with good scientific fidelity, and directly supports scientific analysis using the individual source data; (2) facilitates analysis of a wide range of statistical properties for classes of X-ray sources; and (3) provides efficient access to calibrated observational data and ancillary data products for individual X-ray sources, so that users can perform detailed further analysis using existing tools. The catalog includes real X-ray sources detected with flux estimates that are at least 3 times their estimated 1σ uncertainties in at least one energy band, while maintaining the number of spurious sources at a level of ≲1 false source per field for a 100 ks observation. For each detected source, the CSC provides commonly tabulated quantities, including source position, extent, multi-band fluxes, hardness ratios, and variability statistics, derived from the observations in which the source is detected. In addition to these traditional catalog elements, for each X-ray source the CSC includes an extensive set of file-based data products that can be manipulated interactively, including source images, event lists, light curves, and spectra from each observation in which a source is detected.}

We model the light curves as a continuous time stochastic process, providing a natural means of estimating the characteristic timescale and amplitude of quasar variations. We employ a Bayesian approach to estimate the characteristic timescale and amplitude of flux variations; our approach is not affected by biases introduced from discrete sampling effects. We find that the characteristic timescales strongly correlate with black hole mass and luminosity, and are consistent with disk orbital or thermal timescales. In addition, the amplitude of short-timescale variations is significantly anticorrelated with black hole mass and luminosity. We interpret the optical flux fluctuations as resulting from thermal fluctuations that are driven by an underlying stochastic process, such as a turbulent magnetic field. In addition, the intranight variations in optical flux implied by our empirical model are ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.02 mag, consistent with current microvariability observations of radio-quiet quasars. Our stochastic model is therefore able to unify both long- and short-timescale optical variations in radio-quiet quasars as resulting from the same underlying process, while radio-loud quasars have an additional variability component that operates on timescales ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 day.},

  abstract={Robust fast methods to classify variable light curves in large sky surveys are becoming increasingly important. While it is relatively straightforward to identify common periodic stars and particular transient events (supernovae, novae, microlensing events), there is no equivalent for non-periodic continuously varying sources (quasars, aperiodic stellar variability). In this paper, we present a fast method for modeling and classifying such sources. We demonstrate the method using ~86, 000 variable sources from the OGLE-II survey of the LMC and ~2700 mid-IR-selected quasar candidates from the OGLE-III survey of the LMC and SMC. We discuss the location of common variability classes in the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that quasars occupy a distinct region of variability space, providing a simple quantitative approach to the variability selection of quasars.}

    abstract = "{The new multiwavelength monitoring campaign on NGC 5548 shows clearly that the variability of the ultraviolet (UV)/optical light curves lags by progressively longer times at longer wavelengths, as expected from reprocessing off an optically thick disc, but that the time-scales are longer than expected for a standard Shakura–Sunyaev accretion disc. We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing model to simulate the UV/optical light curves of NGC 5548. We show that disc reprocessing of the observed hard X-ray light curve produces optical light curves with too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Suppressing the fast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays from illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to atomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the scaleheight, making it less dense and less able to thermalize, so that it radiates low-temperature Comptonized emission as required to produce the soft X-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonized disc region emits far-UV (FUV) flux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc, but while this gives reprocessed variable emission that is much closer to the observed UV and optical light curves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the data. We reverse engineer a solution to match the observations and find that the luminosity and temperature of the lagged emission are not consistent with material at the light travel lag distance responding to the irradiating flux (either FUV or X-ray). We conclude that the UV/optical lags of NGC 5548 are neither the light travel time from X-ray reprocessing nor the light travel time from FUV reprocessing, but instead could be the time-scale for the outer blackbody disc vertical structure to respond to the changing FUV illumination.}",

  abstract={Motivated by recent progress in the statistical modeling of quasar variability, we develop a new approach to measuring emission-line reverberation lags to estimate the size of broad-line regions (BLRs) in active galactic nuclei. Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and displaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light curves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the time lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical formalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the problems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated errors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31 quasars and reassess the BLR size-luminosity relationship using 60 Hβ lags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation methods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad range of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines and continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and provides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these correlations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line velocity-delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent lags or line responses. We use this to detect the scaling of the BLR size with continuum luminosity in NGC 5548.}

@article{sesar2007,
	Abstract = {We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS stripe 82, which lies along the celestial equator in the southern Galactic hemisphere (22 h 24 m < Î± J2000.0 < 04 h 08 m , -1.27$\,^{\circ}$ < ÎŽ J2000.0 < +1.27$\,^{\circ}$, ~290 deg 2 ), and contains 34 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz system for 748,084 unresolved sources at high Galactic latitudes ( b < -20$\,^{\circ}$) that were observed at least four times in each of the ugri bands (with a median of 10 observations obtained over ~6 yr). In each photometric bandpass we compute various low-order light-curve statistics, such as rms scatter, Ï 2 per degree of freedom, skewness, and minimum and maximum magnitude, and use them to select and study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g = 20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands (at high Galactic latitudes). The majority (2 out of 3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of light-curve skewness for quasars and find that it is centered on zero. We find that about one-fourth of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of light-curve skewness in the g - r versus u - g color-color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like behavior). Using over 600 RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to the expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that it will obtain well-sampled, 2% accurate, multicolor light curves for ~2 million low-redshift quasars and discover at least 50 million variable stars.},

  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {We present a radio-quiet quasar at z = 0.237 discovered “turning on” by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The transient, iPTF 16bco, was detected by iPTF in the nucleus of a galaxy with an archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum with weak narrow-line emission characteristic of a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Our follow-up spectra show the dramatic appearance of broad Balmer lines and a power-law continuum characteristic of a luminous ( erg s−1) type 1 quasar 12 yr later. Our photometric monitoring with PTF from 2009–2012 and serendipitous X-ray observations from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey in 2011 and 2015 constrain the change of state to have occurred less than 500 days before the iPTF detection. An enhanced broad Hα/[O iii] λ5007 line ratio in the type 1 state relative to other changing-look quasars also is suggestive of the most rapid change of state yet observed in a quasar. We argue that the >10 increase in Eddington ratio inferred from the brightening in UV and X-ray continuum flux is more likely due to an intrinsic change in the accretion rate of a preexisting accretion disk than an external mechanism such as variable obscuration, microlensing, or the tidal disruption of a star. However, further monitoring will be helpful in better constraining the mechanism driving this change of state. The rapid “turn-on” of the quasar is much shorter than the viscous infall timescale of an accretion disk and requires a disk instability that can develop around a  black hole on timescales less than 1 yr.}

  title = {Discovery of 21 New Changing-look {AGNs} in the Northern Sky},
  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {The rare case of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the appearance or disappearance of broad Balmer emission lines within a few years, challenges our understanding of the AGN unified model. We present a sample of 21 new CL AGNs at , which doubles the number of such objects known to date. These new CL AGNs were discovered in various ways, from (1) repeat spectra in the SDSS, (2) repeat spectra in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and SDSS, and (3) photometric variability and new spectroscopic observations. We use the photometric data from surveys, including the SDSS imaging survey, the Pan-STARRS1, the DESI Legacy imaging survey, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, and the Palomar Transient Factory. The estimated upper limits of the transition timescale of the CL AGNs in this sample spans from 0.9 to 13 years in the rest-frame. The continuum flux in the optical and mid-infrared becomes brighter when the CL AGNs turn on, or vice versa. Variations of more than 0.2 mag in the W1 band were detected in 15 CL AGNs during the transition. The optical and mid-infrared variability is not consistent with the scenario of variable obscuration in 10 CL AGNs at more than the 3σ confidence level. We confirm a bluer-when-brighter trend in the optical. However, the mid-infrared WISE colors W1–W2 become redder when the objects become brighter in the W1 band, possibly due to a stronger hot dust contribution in the W2 band when the AGN activity becomes stronger. The physical mechanism of type transition is important for understanding the evolution of AGNs.}
