% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

We use the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS1 or PS1) data to extend  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 quasar light curves. Combined datasets afford 15 year baselines for 9248 quasars, improving on previous studies using SDSS only. We make predictions on fidelity of DRW retrieval once ZTF and LSST data become available.  We fit the light curves with Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, and correlate the DRW parameters -  asymptotic variability amplitude $SF_{\infty}$, and characteristic timescale $\tau$, with quasar properties - black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and redshift. We find that characteristic timescale $\tau$ is more strongly dependent on luminosity, and has a weaker dependence on black hole mass. The variability amplitude is less strongly dependent on the quasar luminosity.

\section{Introduction}

Quasars are inherently variable sources at the rms level of 0.2 mag. They are distant active galactic nuclei, harboring a supermassive black hole surrounded by a hot accretion disk. Although it is agreed upon that majority of optical emission stems from the accretion disk, the detailed origin of variability has been debated over the past 50 years (\citealt{sun2018} and references therein). Some favor a thermal origin of variability \citep{kelly2013}, related to the propagation of inhomogeneities ("hot spots") in the disk \citep{dexter2011, cai2016}, others suggested magnetically elevated disks \citep{dexter2019}, or X-ray reprocessing  \citep{kubota2018}.   Quasar light curves have been successfully described using the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model \citep{kelly2009, macleod2010, kozlowski2010, zu2011, kasliwal2015a}, and the DRW parameters have been linked to the physical quasar properties. \citet{macleod2010} (M10) found correlations of the characteristic timescale and variability amplitude  to the black hole mass, and quasar luminosity.

Variability is also a classification tool, allowing to distinguish quasars from other variable sources that do not exhibit such stochastic variability pattern \citep{macleod2011}. Using the DRW parametrization, \citep{macleod2011} found that DRW timescale and amplitude for QSO are order of  magnitude different from stars. This is especially useful for selecting quasars in the intermediate redshift range (which overlaps the stellar locus in color-color diagrams - see \citealt{sesar2007, yang2017}). Variability has also been used to increase the completeness in measurements of Quasar Luminosity Function (see \citealt{ ross2013, palanque2013, alsayyad2016, mcgreer2013, mcgreer2018}). 

Due to its stochastic nature, the DRW process requires the light curve to be many times longer than the characteristic timescale for an unbiased parameter retrieval. The rule of thumb is that the light curve must be at least ten times longer than its characteristic timescale \citep{kozlowski2010, kozlowski2017a}. For this reason some studies have restricted the probed redshift range, limiting the quasar sample to where one would expect only shorter timescales based on previous studies \citep{sun2018, guo2017}. Others have suffered from short-baseline biases by employing single-survey data \citep{hernitschek2016}.
Thus by extending available quasar light curves we are able to better recover a wider range of DRW timescales, and probe a wider range of redshifts and black hole masses. 


Almost a decade ago \citet{macleod2010} (hereafter M10) published their research using the SDSS Stripe 82 data, and new datasets (PS1,PTF,CRTS) have become available since that can extend the quasar light curves by almost 50\% .  Indeed, \citep{li2018} combined SDSS and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data, to provide a 15 year baseline, but by focusing on a large area to encompass as many quasars as possible (119,305 up to z=4.89) suffered from poor sampling which lends itself better to an ensemble structure function approach rather than direct light curve modeling. On the other hand, \citep{sanchez2018} who employed optical data from QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey, also used the Structure Function parametrization (amplitude of variability and the excess variance), because the light curve length (less than 5 years for 2435 quasars)  excluded the possibility of unbiased retrieval of characteristic timescale. 


 This paper improves on the DRW parameters (Section~\ref{sec:methods} ) describing amplitude and characteristic timescale of Stripe82 quasars by extending the SDSS light curves for well-sampled Stripe82 with PanStarrs1 (PS1) data (Sections~\ref{sec:data} and~\ref{sec:simulation}). We revisit trends between  the DRW parameters and physical quasar properties, such as black hole mass, or bolometric luminosity (Section~\ref{sec:results}). We make predictions for fidelity of DRW parameter retrieval once ZTF and LSST data become available. In this work we adopt a $\Lambda $CDM cosmology with $h_{0} = 0.7$ and $\Omega_{m} = 0.3 $.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{DRW as a Gaussian Process}
Damped Random Walk (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process) can be modeled as a member of a class of Gaussian Processes (GP). Each GP is described by a mean and a kernel - a covariance function that contains a measure of correlation between two points $x_{n}$, $x_{m}$, separted by $\Delta t_{nm}$ (autocorrelation). For the  DRW process, the covariance  between observations of a source separated by $\Delta t_{nm}$ is : 

\begin{eqnarray}
k(\Delta t_{nm}) &=& a \exp{(-\Delta t_{tm} / \tau)} \\
                 &=& \sigma^{2}\exp{(-\Delta t_{tm} / \tau)}  \\
                 &=& \sigma^{2} ACF(\Delta t_{tm})
\end{eqnarray} 

Here $a$ or $\sigma^{2}$ is an amplitude of correlation decay as a function of $t_{tm}$,  while $\tau$ is the characteristic timescale over which correlation drops by $1/e$. For a DRW,  the correlation function $k(\Delta t_{nm})$ is also related to the autocorrelation function $ACF$. 

Not explicitly used in this paper, but of direct relevance to DRW modeling, is the structure function (SF). SF can be found from the data $\{m_{i},t_{i}\}$ as the root-mean-squared of  magnitude differences $\Delta m$  calculated as a function of temporal separation $\Delta t$. SF is directly related to a DRW kernel $k(\Delta t_{nm})$:

\begin{equation}
SF(\Delta t) = SF_{\infty} (1-\exp{(-|\Delta t|/\tau)})^{1/2}
\end{equation}

For quasars the SF follows approximately a power law: $SF \propto \Delta t^{\beta}$,  and it levels out for large time lags $\Delta t$ to a constant value of $SF_{\infty}$.   Note that $SF_\infty = \sqrt{2} \sigma$  in the above (also see \citet{macleod2012, bauer2009, graham2015a} for an overview).


The likelihood is evaluated with   \project{celerite}\citep{foreman2017} - a fast GP solver that scales linearly with the number of data points $\mathcal{O}(N)$ thanks to an optimization that exploits the structure of covariance matrix for kernels that are a mixture of exponentials, such as a DRW kernel\citep{foreman2018,ambikasaran2015}. The method employed is similar to that used by \cite{rybicki1992, kozlowski2010},  M10 - like in previous work, we use a  uniform prior on $\sigma$ and $\tau$.  The main difference is that rather than adopting the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) as the 'best-fit' value for the DRW parameters,  we find the expectation value of the marginalized log posterior. If the posterior space was a 2D Gaussian in $\sigma$, $\tau$ space, the expectation value would coincide with the maximum of the log posterior. However, due to non-Gaussian shape of the log posterior, the expectation value is a better   estimate of $\sigma$ and $\tau$  rather than MAP. 

\subsection{The impact of light curve baseline}\label{sec:baseline}

K17 reports that one cannot trust any results of DRW fitting unless the light curve length is at least ten times longer than the characteristic timescale. We confirm these generic trends by repeating his simulation setup. We  model 10 000  DRW light curves with fixed length (baseline) $t_{exp}=8$ years, $\mathrm{SF}_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag, SDSS or OGLE-like cadence, sampling over a range of input timescales. Given fixed baseline, this means exploring the parameter space of $\rho = \tau / t_{exp}$, $\rho \in   \{ 0.01 : 15\}$. We simulate 100 light curves at each $\rho$. 

\begin{figure*}
\plottwo{figs/SDSS_Jeff1_expectation.png}{figs/OGLE_Jeff1_expectation.png}
\caption{Probing the parameter space of $\rho = \tau / t_{exp}$, with a simulation of  10 000 light curves : 100 light curves per each of 100 $\rho$ values spaced uniformly in logarithmic space between $\rho \in   \{ 0.01 : 15\}$ . Thus with the baseline $t_{exp}$ set to 8 years,  we sample a range of 100 input timescales, as in K17. Left panel shows the SDSS-like cadence with N=60 points, and the right panel OGLE-like cadence with N=445 points. The dotted horizontal and solid vertical lines represent $\rho = 0.1$, i.e. the baseline is ten times longer than considered timescale. The diagonal line is $y=x$, i.e. the line that would be followed if the recovered  $\rho$ ($\tau$) was exactly the same as the input $\rho$ ($\tau$).} 
\label{fig:rho_space}
\end{figure*}

To simulate observational conditions  we add to the true underlying signal  $s(t)$ a noise offset, $n(t)$.  Like K17,  we assume $n(t)$ to be drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma(t))$ with a width $\sigma(t)$ , corresponding to the  photometric uncertainty at the given epoch,  $e(t)$) : 

\begin{equation}
y(t) = s(t) + n(t) 
\end{equation}

The $s(t)$ is found by iterating over the array of time steps $t$.  At each step, we draw a point from a Gaussian distribution, for which the mean and standard deviation are re-calculated at each timestep. Starting at $t_{0}$, the signal is equal to the mean magnitude, $s_{0} = m$. After a timestep $\Delta t_{i} = t_{i+1} - t_{i}$, the signal $s_{i+1}$ is drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(loc, stdev)$, with : 

\begin{equation}
loc = s_{i} e ^ { - r  }  + m \left( 1 - e ^{ - r }\right)
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
stdev^{2} =  0.5  \, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}^{2} \left( 1 - e ^{  - 2 r  }  \right)
\end{equation}

where  $r = \Delta t_{i} / \tau$, $\tau$ is the damping timescale,   $SF_{\infty}$ is the  variability amplitude , and $m$ the mean magnitude.  This follows the formalizm in \cite{kelly2009} (eqs. A4 and A5) as well as in \cite{macleod2010} (Sec. 2.2 ), and is equivalent to the setup of  K17. 


We adopt SDSS S82-like cadence with N=60 epochs, or OGLE-III like cadence with N=445 epochs.  The errors are set by the adopted mean magnitudes, $r=17$ and $I=18$ :

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{SDSS}^{2} &=& 0.013^{2} + \exp{(2 (r-23.36))} \\
\sigma_{OGLE}^{2} &=& 0.004^{2} + \exp{(1.63 (I - 22.55))}
\end{eqnarray}



Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_space} confirms the findings of K17:  recovered $\rho$ becomes meaningless ('unconstrained') if the available DRW light curve baseline is not at least ten times longer than the input timescale. It also means that by extending the baseline we can move from the biased region to the unbiased regime.  Encouraged by this result, we extend the baselines of  quasar light curves, and revisit relations studied by  M10. 


\subsection{Departure from DRW?}

The power spectral density (PSD) of the DRW process is:

\begin{equation}
P(f) = \frac{4\sigma^{2}\tau}{1+(2 \pi \tau f)^{2}}
\end{equation}
(with $\sigma = \mathrm{SF}_{\infty} / \sqrt{2}$, $\tau$ is the characteristic timescale, $f$ is the frequency), so that $P(f) \propto f^{-2}$  at high frequencies $f > (2\pi \tau)^{-1}$, and levels to a constant value at lower frequencies\citep{kelly2014}. This can be parametrized as $P(f) \propto f^{\alpha_h}$ at high frequencies (short timescales), and  $P(f) \propto f^{\alpha_l}$  at low frequencies (long timescales), so that for a pure DRW process $\alpha_{h}=-2$ and $\alpha_{l} = 0$.  

Various opinions exist about the exact value of  $\alpha_{l}$ and $\alpha{h}$ for accurate description of quasar variability,  or more broadly speaking -  AGN variability. 

One approach comes from studying optical light curves of wide-field, ground-based photometric surveys, such as OGLE, SDSS, or PS1. In general, these studies used  light curves with rather sparse non-uniform sampling, cadence of few epochs per week,  and overall length (baseline) of the order of several years.  
For instance, \citep{zu2013}  using 223 $I$-band  OGLE quasar  light curves (baseline of  $\approx7$ years, $\approx570$ epochs) considered whether different covariance functions (powered-exponential, Mat\`ern, Kepler-exponential, Pareto exponential - see Eqs.5,6,8,9 in \citealt{zu2013}) may present a better fit, and found that while there may be small deviations, they are not significant enough to depart from a robust DRW description.  Similarly, \citep{sun2018} found that the data quality of SDSS-like light curves is insufficient to distinguish between CAR(1) and more complex models.   On the longer timescales, \cite{guo2017} with a low-redshift subset of SDSS S82 quasars  claims  that the low-frequency slope  $\alpha_{l}$ should not be steeper than $-1.3$. For the same SDSS S82 quasars,  \citep{kozlowski2017a} (as well as \cite{kozlowski2016b} and \citep{caplar2017}) found PSD slopes $\alpha_{h} \leqslant -2$, which meant that models assuming a DRW $\alpha_{h}=2$ would result in decorrelation timescales biased low. He stated that it is currently not possible to distinguish between close-to-DRW and DRW processes for the S82 quasars because good sampling at both low frequencies (long timescales, white noise part), and high frequencies (short timescales, red / pink noise part). However, \cite{simm2016} used a limited PS1 sample of 90 X-ray selected AGN, and with PS1 data found that their data can be described by a broken power law with low-frequency slope  of $-1$ and high frequency slope from $-2$ to $-4$, with a break at timescale between $~200$ to $~300$ days.   

A second approach of excellent cadence but short baselines  is afforded by a space based Kepler mission\cite{borucki2010}, observing without the interruption of the atmosphere. Using Kepler light curves   with a half-hour cadence enabled an unprecedented view of the high-frequency part of the AGN spectrum, but the results are inconclusove. \cite{mushotzky2011}  analyzed the four AGN light curves from 2010-2011 (three separate quarters), and found evidence of steeper slopes ($\alpha_{h} ~ -2.6 $ to $ -3.1$).  Later,  \cite{edelson2014} combined $3.4$ yr worth of data ($13$ quarters)  for an AGN Zw 229-15, and found the slope increasing from $~ -2 $ to $~ -4 $ at frequency corresponding to 5 day timescale. \cite{smith2018} used 4 years of Kepler data for 21 AGN,  and found slopes generally steeper than the DRW, between $-2$ and $-3.4$ . They also concluded that, in accordance with \cite{caplar2017}, perhaps AGN are described by a combination of DRW behavior, and a changing PSD, tied to an accretion duty cycle. With the original  Kepler  mission ending in   2013 with the failure of the second reaction wheel,  it transitioned to K2, pointing at various fields around the ecliptic, which limits further the available baseline for AGN study.  \citep{aranzana2018} conducted the most extensive study of K2 AGN light curves to date, including 252 well-sampled AGN. Using data spanning 80 days they find a range of high-frequency slopes from $-1$ to $-3.2$, with the median of $-2.2$,  consistent with the DRW model.

% may also mention here  Caplar2017 and his PTF studies ? 


% perhaps skip, about the impact of PSD shape on the RM studies  .... 
The exact shape of quasar PSD would affect other areas of study. One example is reverberation mapping (RM), which was used to provide  accurate black hole mass estimates. RM is based on measuring the lags between light curves observed at different wavelengths. The two most widely used approaches to measuring interband lags are interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF, \citealt{gaskell1987, peterson2004})  and  light curve modeling via Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (JAVELIN, \citealt{zu2011}). The PSD of the DRW comes explicitly in the latter,  which assumes that the higher energies drive lower energies (whether due to x-ray reprocessing or other mechanism), and that the driving light curve is well-modeled by a DRW (with PSD equal to  $-2$ or flatter).  In this scenario other light curves (at longer wavelength) are related to it via transfer function \cite{edelson2019}. Using a wrong PSD means at best that errors are underestimated. Therefore a convincing detection of a departure of quasar PSD from that of the DRW  would have  a direct impact on RM studies that use  JAVELIN or other light curve modeling tools. 


In the end, we follow the direction laid out in M10, Sec.4.4, which shows that while within S82 sampling assuming $\alpha_{h}= 2 $ it is impossible to reliably distinguish between a $\alpha_{l}=0$ and $-1$. A future study with appropriate cadence would be necessary to model each quasar individually with different $\alpha_{l}$ and $\alpha_{h}$. We elect to use the DRW description ($\alpha_{l}=0$, $\alpha_{h}=-2$) to allow a better comparison of our results with M10.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}
\subsection{Surveys}
We focus on THE data pertaining to a 290 deg$^{2}$ region of southern sky, repeatedly observed by SDSS between 1998 and 2008. Originally aimed at supernova discovery, objects in this area, known as Stripe82 (S82), were  re-observed on average 60 times (see \citealt{macleod2012} Sec. 2.2 for overview, and \citealt{annis2014} for details ) . Availability of well-calibrated \citep{ivezic2007}, long-baseline light curves spurred variability research (see \citealt{sesar2007}). The catalog prepared by \citep{schneider2008} as part of DR9  contains 9258 spectroscopically confirmed quasars.

The width of each rectangle corresponds to the extent of light curves available (or simulated) for Stripe 82 quasars for each survey. For SDSS this means DR7; for CRTS DR2, PS1 DR2, PTF DR2, ZTF year 2018, and LSST the full 10-year survey. The lower edge of each rectangle corresponds to the $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude (SDSS r, PS1 r, PTF R, ZTF r, LSST r, CRTS V). The vertical extent corresponds to the total survey area (for SDSS, up to and including DR15).  Note how PS1 and PTF extend the baseline of SDSS by approximately $50\%$, and how inclusion of LSST triples the SDSS baseline. For reference, the area covered by LSST is $25 000$ sq.deg., which corresponds to  $60\%$ of the sky. The whole sky has an area of $4\pi$ steradians (41253 sq.deg.).}

We extend the SDSS  light curves with PanSTARRS (PS1) \citep{chambers2011,flewelling2018}, CRTS \citep{drake2009}, and PTF \citep{rau2009} data. We find 9248 PS1 matches, 6455 PTF matches, and 7737 CRTS matches to SDSS S82 quasars. There are  6444 quasars with SDSS-PS1-PTF-CRTS data.  Fig~\ref{fig:lcExtent}  depicts the  baseline coverage of various surveys.  Each survey uses a unique set of bandpasses and cadences : SDSS light curves contain near-simultaneous $\{u,g,r,i,z\}_{SDSS}$ , and the others are  non-simultaneous : $\{g,r,i,z,y\}_{PS1}$ ,  $\{g,R\}_{PTF}$, $V_{CRTS}$.  

\subsection{Photometric offsets}

We combine the photometry into a single 'master' bandpass. We choose SDSS r as the target since it has the best photometry, and we calculate color terms that afford transformation from other photometric systems to SDSS. We elect only to translate to SDSS $r$ photometry from nearby filters : ($\{g,R\}_{PTF}$, $\{g,r,i\}_{PS1}$, $V_{CRTS}$). 

Color terms are derived using SDSS standard stars catalog~\citep{ivezic2007}.  We focused on 10\% subset of randomly chosen stars from the catalog, and found CRTS (B.Sesar, priv.comm.), PS1 (from MAST \url{http://panstarrs.stsci.edu}) and PTF (IRSA PTF Object Catalog \url{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/}) matches. 

We consider the difference  between the target (SDSS) and source (eg.PS1) photometry as a function of mean SDSS $(g-i)$ color : 


\begin{equation}
m_{PS1} - m_{SDSS} = f(g-i)
\end{equation}

While \cite{tonry2012} chose to spread the stellar locus with $(g-r)$ color, we prefer to use the $(g-i)$ color since it provides a larger wavelength baseline. Some authors (eg. \citet{li2018}) allow $f(g-i)$ to be a higher-order polynomial, but since we limit the transformation to the  region of $(g-i)$ space occupied by quasars (Fig.~\ref{fig:quasarColors}), we find that the linear fit is sufficient (see Fig. ~\ref{fig:offsetsPS1}).   Table ~\ref{tab:offsets} shows the offsets used to transform PS1, CRTS and PTF to SDSS $r$-band.

%NOTE ABOUT EXTINCTION:  due to dust present between us and the standard stars (or background quasars), the observed light will appear slightly redder because dust preferentially scatters blue light away. This depends on the location of the source on the  sky and is related to the dust inhomogeneities in the Milky Way. 

%However, in deriving bandpass to bandpass transformation all that matters is the flux received at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), for which all photometry is corrected at the pipeline processing level (both for SDSS,  PTF, PS1, and CRTS). In other words, all that matters is that any SED at TOA will have slightly different magnitude (hence colors) depending on whether we observe it with SDSS(r),  PS1(r), or PTF(R).  Therefore, to derive photometric offsets (which are time-independent), we use Sloan colors not corrected for extincton (and likewise, PS1, PTF, etc.) .  

%Correction for insterstellar extinction is only needed for color selection, since otherwise objects would appear to be of the later stellar type (redder) than they really are. To correct for extinction we use the most up-to-date maps of stellar extinction Bayestar17 (Green+2018). These extinction maps are 3D probabilistic, and we assume a uniform distance of 4 kpc for the dust column for all stars.

\section{Simulations : lessons learned}\label{sec:simulation}

We simulate the theoretical improvement in the retrieved DRW parameters in combined light curves by generating long and well-sampled light curves, all with input $\tau = 575 $ days, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag (the median of S82 distribution in M10). We then select SDSS, or SDSS-PS1 segments, sampling at the cadence corresponding to real light curves. We also predict the contribution of ZTF and LSST data (Fig.~\ref{fig:simLC}). For the ZTF 1-year segment (Spring 2019 ZTF Data Release will include data from 2018) we assumed 120 observations in ZTFg and ZTFr (every three nights), deriving the error model from the ZTF data for standard stars (Fig.~\ref{fig:ztf_errors}). For the LSST 10-year segment (final LSST DR10 in 2031) we assumed 50 epochs per year, randomly distributed throughout the year, with the following error model:

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{LSST}(m)^{2} = \sigma_{sys}^{2} + \sigma_{rand}^{2} \,\, \mathrm{(mag)}^{2}\\
\sigma_{rand}^{2} = (0.04-\gamma)x + \gamma x^{2} \\
x = 10^{0.4(m-m_{5})}
\end{eqnarray}

with  $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005$, $\gamma=0.039$, $m_{5} = 24.7$ (see Sec. 3.2 in \citet{ivezic2019}).

\begin{figure*}%[ht!]
\plotone{figs/1072282_w_LSST1.png}
\caption{Simulated DRW process sampled at the real cadence of SDSS, PS1 segments for quasar SDSSdbID=1072282,  adding the simulated LSST segment.

\end{figure*} 

\begin{figure}%[ht!]

\caption{The rms spread as a function of magnitude for ZTF non-variable stars with over 100 observations. We overplot the functional describing the adopted error model (after \citealt{ivezic2019}). Properties of ZTF photometric uncertainties are largely similar to the PTF uncertainties.}
\label{fig:ztf_errors}
\end{figure} 


To mirror observational conditions we add to the true underlying DRW signal a Gaussian noise, with variance defined by photometric uncertainties for corresponding surveys. Given the noise properties of each survey (Fig.~\ref{fig:combinedLCerrors}), we found that relatively large uncertainties of CRTS and PTF segments introduced less improvement in recovery of DRW parameters, given that similar baseline is already covered by the PS1 data.  We further found that inclusion of ZTF data for 2018 would not significantly change our results. Inclusion of PS1 data with its excellent photometry (as compared to ZTF or PTF) is the best improvement over existing SDSS results.  In the future (after more data has been assembled and re-calibrated) ZTF will help, but not as dramatically as LSST (see Fig.~\ref{fig:simLCresults1}).  For this reason we found that using only SDSS-PS1 portion is the best tradeoff between adding more baseline vs introducing more uncertainty with noisy data. Fig.~\ref{fig:simLC} illustrates  of  the simulated light curve. 

\begin{figure}%[ht!]
\plotone{figs/sim_subsampled2_stats_error_lin.png}
\caption{Distribution of median photometric uncertainties ('errors') in combined r-band real light curves. This shows that the PTF and ZTF segments have much larger errors than SDSS, PS1. This is the reason for using only SDSS-PS1 part of the combined light curve.}
\label{fig:combinedLCerrors}
\end{figure} 

As we found earlier, extending the light curve baseline decreases the bias in the retrieved DRW parameters (Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_space}). For light curves that simulate the extension of SDSS with PS1, ZTF, LSST segments, Figs.~\ref{fig:simLCresults1} and~\ref{fig:simLCresults2} show that this is indeed the case: the longer the light curves, that more the retrieved $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ are centered on the input values.

\section{Results: fitting SDSS-PS1 with Celerite}\label{sec:results}

We have extended the baseline of Stripe82 quasars by adding to SDSS r-band data the  PS1 g,r,i data, transformed into common SDSS r-band. As the variability originates in the accretion disk, we shift all timescales to quasar rest frame : $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}} = \tau_{\mathrm{OBS}} / (1+z)$. 


\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/MacLeod2010_Fig3_restframe.png}
\caption{Comparing the rest-frame timescales $\tau$, and asymptotic variability amplitudes $SF_{\infty}$, for M10 SDSS r-band,  and combined SDSS and PS1 data.  }
\label{fig:tauRF_SFinf}
\end{figure*} 


We first show that our results are consistent with M10 when using only the SDSS r-band : on Fig.~\ref{fig:tauRF_SFinf}) the distributions of $\tau$, $SF_{\infty}$ from M10 (red) and our results (blue) coincide. Furthermore, when comparing object-by-object M10 to our SDSS-only results we find a very good agreement (see Fig.~\ref{fig:celeriteCompare}).

\caption{Plot comparing results for SDSS r-band fitting of  M10 ($\sigma_{m}, \tau_{m}$), and current results for SDSS r-band using Celerite ($\sigma_{fit}, \tau_{fit}$). }
\label{fig:celeriteCompare}
\end{figure*} 


\subsection{Rest-frame Wavelength Correction}

Prior to looking for correlations with physical quantities (black hole mass, luminosities, redshifts), we correct $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ for wavelength dependence using formulae from M10. Since quasars are all at different redshifts, the same observed band would probe a different rest-frame wavelength $\lambda_{RF}$ for each quasar. We find that the power law employed by M10:
\begin{equation}
f \propto \left( \frac{\lambda_{RF}}{4000 \mbox{\AA}} \right)^{B}
\end{equation}
together with the fit coefficients $B=-0.479$ and $0.17$ for $SF_{\infty}$ and $\tau$, respectively, are adequate for combined SDSS-PS1 results, as shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:wavelength_dependence} . 

  
\begin{figure*}

\caption{Rest-frame timescale $\tau$ (top panel), and asymptotic structure function $SF_{\infty}$ (bottom panel), as a function of rest-frame wavelength $\lambda_{RF}$. The background contours show M10 SDSS $ugriz$ data, and the foreground contours  denote our results using  SDSS (red) and SDSS-PS1 (orange) segments. The red line indicates the best-fit power law to M10 data, with $B=0.17$ an $-0.479$ for $\tau_{RF}$, and $SF_{\infty}$, respectively.}
\label{fig:wavelength_dependence}
\end{figure*} 


\subsection{Trends with Luminosity, Black Hole Mass, and Redshift}

Here we examine the main scientific results: correlations between variability parameters  ($\tau, SF{\infty}$), and the physical properties of quasars: absolute i-band magnitude $M_{i}$, and black hole mass $M_{BH}$. 


\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/macleod2010_Fig12_Shen2011.png}
\caption{Distribution of quasars as a function of  redshift, observed i-band magnitude, absolute i-band magnitude (K-corrected to z=2), and virial black hole mass. All quantities from \citep{shen2011}. }
\label{fig:quasar_properties}
\end{figure*} 



First, we consider the selection effects that are inherent to the quasar distribution. Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_properties} shows the distribution of quasars as a function of redshift $z$, i magnitude $M_{i}$, and black hole mass $M_{BH}$. For instance, the trend of increasing redshift with $M_{i}$ on the upper left panel is due to the fact that quasars have to be brighter to be included in the survey at increasing distances. 

It is difficult to estimate a black hole mass based on spectral information.  Considering  available catalogs of quasar properties,  we find that the most complete for S82 quasars is \cite{shen2011}, which we elect to use in the following sections. As explained in \citep{shen2008,shen2011}, the most common approach to estimate quasar black hole mass is to assume that the broad-line region (BLR) is virialized, so that the continuum luminosity can be used as a proxy for the BLR radius, and the width of the broad emission lines (or line dispersion) is used to compute the virial velocity. As quasar spectrum gets redshifted, there are different favorite calibrated  emission lines of choice: broad H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, Mg\,{\sc ii}, and C\,{\sc iv} \citep{vestergaard2002}.% some authors, eg. \cite{sanchez2017} chose to study separately trends with M_BH(CIV) and M_BH(MgII)...  we don't think it's necessary ... 

For sources variable at \~0.2 mag level, such as quasars, the ideal is to use single-epoch calibrated spectra to estimate continuum luminosity, and find virial black hole masses using relationships based on the monochromatic fluxes and broad line widths. A glance at the available quasar catalogs reveals that, given any SDSS data release, there is indeed first a catalog of basic quasar properties (redshift and photometry - eg. \citealt{schneider2007, schneider2010}), and more detailed catalogs contaiining black hole masses and bolometric luminosities  follow (eg. \citealt{shen2008, shen2011}). More recently, once SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog \citep{paris2017} was released,  \citep{kozlowski2017a} followed using SDSS photometry as a proxy for monochromatic luminosities.\citep{chen2018} added a detailed analysis of continuum luminosities in the  H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ regions for low-redshift quasars. Using the spectra from Chinese LAMOST survey \citep{dong2018} also sought to estimate virial black hole masses, and the results, while consistent with \citep{shen2011}, suffered from the necessity to peg the non-calibrated spectra to the SDSS photometry which was taken  a different epoch. Thus even though the SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog \cite{paris2018}  is the most recent, like \citep{paris2017} it lacks black hole masses and bolometric luminosities, and there is no recent work that re-analyzed the spectral data. \citep{shen2011} remains the best to date measurements of quasar black hole masses and monochromatic luminosities, based directly on the single-epoch spectra. 



Bolometric luminosity is most often estimated from the absolute i-band magnitude, $M_{i}$ (see \citealt{shen2008}, Fig.2). $M_{i}$ is derived from the observed i-band magnitude, by correcting for Galactic extinction, and correcting for the fact that at different redshifts different portions of the spectral energy distribution are observed by the telescope filter bandpass. The latter, known as K-correction $K(z)$ \citep{oke1968},  is defined as $m_{intrinsic} = m_{observed} - K(z)$. In the early 2000`s the common approach was to K-correct to redshift 0, but as \citep{richards2006a} pointed out, since the distribution of quasars peaks at redshift 2, for most quasars correcting to the redshift of 0 required shifting the observed spectrum into the far infrared. Moreover, the procedure was to correct separately for the continuum and emission line contributions, assuming a particular spectral shape (eg. power law  $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=-0.5$ - see \citealt{schneider2010, vandenberk2001, richards2006a}).  This introduces a larger error for K(z=0) than for K(z=2) if the assumed spectral shape $\alpha=-0.5$ is far from the real spectral index. In early 2010`s, after  \citealt{richards2006a, wisotzki2000, blanton2003},  the practice started shifting towards K-correcting to redshift 2,  and including custom qusasar spectral shapes, as reflected by the content of \cite{shen2011} quasar catalog. Thus in this study we use  the absolute i-band magnitude K-corrected to z=2: $M_{i}(z=2)$ from \citep{shen2011}.

The slope of -0.9 (solid line) is much steeper than -0.23 found by M10 with the SDSS only data. }
\label{fig:eddington_ratio}
\end{figure*} 



We show on  Fig.~\ref{fig:sf_tau_bh_mass_luminosity} $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ as a function of absolute magnitude $M_{i}$, redshift z, and black hole mass $M_{BH}$. We investigate these correlations in more detail fitting to  $f$ is $\tau_{RF}$ or $SF_{\infty}$ a power law , using a Bayesian linear regression method that incorporates measurement uncertainties in all latent variables \citep{kelly2007b} : 


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:powlawmodel}
\log_{10}{f} = &A& + B \log_{10}\left( \lambda_{RF} / 4000 \mbox{\AA} \right) + C (M_{i} + 23) \nonumber \\
&+& D \log_{10}{\left( M_{BH} / 10^{9} M_{\odot}  \right)} 
\end{eqnarray} 



M10 fitted  this model independently to each of the five SDSS bands, reporting the band-averaged coefficients - Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodShen2011} shows the example of posterior samples for $f=SF_{\infty}$ correlating the  M10 SDSS ugriz data against an updated quasar catalog of \citep{shen2011}. Since we use combined SDSS r-band and PS1 data, we only compare our results to M10 SDSS r-band.  


\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/Chelsea_ugriz_Shen2011_SF.png}
\caption{Table 1 in M10 reported the band-averaged values for fit coefficients A,C,D for Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}.  Shown here are samples from posterior MCMC draws using M10 results for  $f=SF_{\infty}$, against \citealt{shen2011} $M_{i}$ and $M_{BH}$. Because the mean of posterior for SDSS r-band results only  (bold, solid lines) are different from the mean of band-averaged values (dashed lines),  we compare our SDSS-PS1 combined r-band results against M10 SDSS r-band only.}
\label{fig:MacLeodShen2011}
\end{figure*} 


We have shown on Figs.~\ref{fig:tauRF_SFinf} and~\ref{fig:celeriteCompare} that the fitted DRW parameters  $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$  using only SDSS segment are consistent with those of M10. Using SDSS segment we also recover similar trends with $M_{BH}$ and $M_{i}$. Fig.~\ref{fig:tauRF_SFinf} demonstrates that adding PS1 data the $\tau - SF_{\infty}$ distribution changes.  For $f=SF_{\infty}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}, Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011sf} shows that with the addition of PS1 data there is a stronger dependence of variability amplitude on quasar luminosity, but a smaller dependence on the black hole mass. For $f=\tau$  in Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}, Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011tau} there is a weaker trend with both luminosity and black hole mass.

The results from SDSS-only portion are consistent with M10 for the single band. Inclusion of the PS1 portion decreases the timescale dependence on black hole mass, but increases the luminosity dependence. This can be understood as a rotation of the plane in ($\tau$, $M_{i}$, $M_{BH}$) coordinates.  }

\subsection{Comparison to other studies}


\cite{sun2018} using 1000 low-z S82 QSO finds that variability amplitude is correlated with the inverse of bolometric luminosity, and suggests that since $\hat{\sigma}$ is so well related to $L
_{bol}$, perhaps we could use the $\hat{\sigma} - L_{bol}$ relation to derive $L_{bol}$ without assuming any cosmological models. Our work suggests that with added PS1 data, $\tau$ is more strongly dependent on luminosity than with only SDSS data.  This is consistent with findings of \cite{sun2018}, who concluded with Structure Function analysis of their luminosity-matched quasar sample, that $\tau$ depends mostly on the bolometric luminosity. 



In principle any tight correlation between the variability parameters and physical properties of quasars could be used to infer eg.  black hole mass or bolometric luminosity  given only the optical time-series. In the era of large synoptic surveys (PS1, ZTF,LSST), this could provide additional information about quasars for which it will be impractical to obtain a spectrum \citep{sanchez2018}.


The dominant trend in quasar properties is the Eigenvector-1 : the anti-correlation between the broad line Fe {\sc ii} emission, and the strength of the narrow O{\sc iii} ($5007 \mbox{\AA}$) line\cite{wang1996}. \citep{shen2014} argued from quasar clustering analysis that the entire diversity of quasars in  the quasar main sequence can be explained by variation in accretion (expressed in $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ - the ratio of the equivalent width of   Fe{\sc ii}  between $4435-4685$ $\mbox{\AA}$ and H$\beta$), or orientation effects (affecting the full-width at half-maximum of the H$\beta$ broad line). In particular, \citep{shen2014} suggests that $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ increases with  the Eddington ratio, i.e. is anticorrelated with $M_{BH}$. This finding was confirmed by \cite{sun2015} with measurements of black hole mass from the quasar host galaxy stellar dispersion $\sigma_{*}$ (using the $M_{BH} - \sigma_{*}$ relation - \citealt{ferrarese2000, kormendy2013}). For this reason,  \citep{sun2018} chose to explore the evolution of quasar variability in narrow redshift range, as a function of  $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ and $L_{bol}$. 



X-ray reprocessing is also consistent with  the dependence of $\hat{\sigma}$ on the Fe{\sc ii} strength, studied by \citep{sun2018}. 


Part of the unaccounted for scatter could be due to variations in metallicity.  As \cite{jiang2016} points out based on three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations, the iron opacity bump may have a strong influence on the stability of an accretion disk, and thus link metallicity to AGN variability. This would also be consistent with findings of \cite{sun2018} if quasars with high  Fe{\sc ii} strength have higher metallicity, and have more stable disks. 

% Zhu2016 : The corona is generally assumed to work as a light bulb above the disk and modulates radiation from the disk, encoding information about sizes and distances in the form of time lags between light curves in different photometric bands. This is the famous X-ray reprocessing model (Krolik et al. 1991), and it has been tested in great detail with nearby Seyferts (Sergeev et al. 2005; McHardy et al. 2014; Edelson et al. 2015; Fausnaugh et al. 2016; Troyer et al. 2016). Correlation analysis of inter-band (X-ray/UV/optical) light curves typically results in lags of less than a few days (for a short review, see Lawrence 2012), likely corresponding to light travel time. However, it should be kept in mind that X-ray only contributes to a small fraction of AGNs' total bolometric luminosity, especially for brighter ones (Strateva et al. 2005; Grupe et al. 2010; Lusso et al. 2010), and thus could be insufficient to produce the observed UV/optical variation (Gaskell 2008).



\citep{guo2017} uses a low-redshift (z<1.2), low black hole mass ($\log_{10}{(M_{BH}<9)}$)  subsample of the SDSS S82 r-band quasar light curves. Using Javelin \cite{zu2011} code they fitted DRW model for $\tau$, $SF_{\infty}$ 


The variability on several years timescale can be explained by the reprocessing model \cite{kokubo2015}, assuming that the AGN UV-optical variability is a results of reprocessing of X-ray or far-UV emission \citep{krolik1991}

\citep{sanchez2018} combined the SDSS spectra with 5 year light curves of 2345 quasars obtained with Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST)-La Silla AGN Variability Survey. Using the Bayesian parametrization of Structure Function \citep{schmidt2010},  SF$(\tau) = A(\tau/1 \mathrm{yr})^{\gamma} $, they found that the amplitude of variability $A$ is anti-correlated with rest-frame emission wavelength,  and Eddington ratio (similar as M10).  Due to limited light curve length they did not consider any correlations with $\tau$. The decreasing of  $A$ with increasing  $\lambda_{rest}$ would naturally follow from the inner regions of the disk being more variable (higher amplitude and  shorter wavelength) - see \citep{fausnaugh2016} and \citep{edelson2015}. The anticorrelation of $A$ and Eddington ratio is consistent with other works (M10, \citealt{simm2016}, \citealt{rakshit2017})


Since multiple studies have found t






Anticorrelation of  variability amplitude and the Eddington ratio  has a variety of possible explanations. 

In thin disk theory \cite{shakura1973, frank2002, netzer2013}, radius of the emission region at given wavelength increases with the Eddington ratio, and is inversely proportional to temperature\cite{rakshit2017}. Thus a hotter disk means that the emission observed in a given bandpass is emitted from a larger radius. From causality, a smaller region can be more variable than a larger one. Therefore, a  hotter disk would be less variable at a given wavelength than a colder one, and  the variability amplitude as studied in a particular bandpass (here, SDSS r-band) would be anticorrelated with Eddington ratio. 




\cite{rakshit2017}  notes that as the Eddington ratio increases,  the radius of emission at a given wavelength increases (higher $L/L_{Edd}$ - hotter disk), leading to a decreased variability amplitude. 

 If Eddington ratio is related 


In the era of changing-look active galaxies ( including initially distinct classes of Changing-Look Quasars \citep{lamassa2015, macleod2019}, Changing-Look AGNs \citep{marchese2012, bianchi2009,risaliti2009}, Changing-Look LINERS \citep{frederick2019} to name a few) there is a revived interest in possibly linking the behavior of stellar-sized accreting systems (eg. Black Hole Binaries),  to that of galactic scale (eg. AGN, QSO, LINERS)\citep{noda2018}. 

It appears that there are several timescales at play, and possibly several interlinked mechanisms that drive the variability. 



One possibility

There is a hierarchy of relevant timescales in the standard optically thick, geometrically thin, $\alpha$-disk model : dynamical, thermal, front, viscous, with   $t_{dyn} < t_{th} < t_{front}  < t_{visc} $ \citep{netzer2013, frank2002}.

The dynamical, or gas orbital, timescale is simply  an inverse of the Keplerian orbital angular frequency $ \Omega$  at radius R  : 

\begin{equation}
t_{dyn} \sim  1 / \Omega = \left( \frac{GM}{R^{3}}\right)^{-1/2}
\end{equation}




The main parameter  describing the accretion disk is $\alpha$ - the ratio of the (vertically averaged) total stress to thermal (vertically averaged) pressure \citep{lasota2016} : 

\begin{equation}
\alpha= \frac{\langle \tau_{r\varphi}  \rangle_{z} }{\langle P \rangle _{z}} 
\end{equation}


After \cite{lasota2016},  the hydrodynamical stress tensor (corresponding to  kinematic viscocity $\nu$) is:

\begin{equation}
\tau_{r\varphi } = \rho \nu \frac{\partial v_{\varphi}}{\partial R} = \rho \nu \frac{d \Omega}{d \ln{R}} = \frac{3 \rho \nu \Omega}{2}  
\end{equation}

so  with  $c_{s}$ -  local sound speed at radius $R$ (isothermal sound speed is $c_{s} = \sqrt{P/\rho}$),

\begin{equation}
\alpha  =   \frac{3 \rho \nu \Omega}{2 P} =  \frac{3 \Omega \nu}{2 c_{s}^{2}}
\end{equation}



This means that smaller $\alpha$ corresponds to less viscous disks. 



The thermal timescale, related to the time needed for re-adjustment to the thermal equilibrium (derived in detail in \cite{frank2002}), is the ratio of heat content per unit disk area to dissipation rate per unit disk area : $(dE / A) / (dE/dt /  A) = dt $.  The heat content per unit volume is $\sim \rho k T / \mu m_{p} \sim \rho c_{s}^{2}$, and heat content per unit area is  $\sim \rho c_{s}^{2} / h \sim \Sigma c_{s}^{2}$. Meanwhile, the dissipation rate per unit area, $D(R)$, is 

\begin{equation}
D(R) = \frac{9}{8} \nu \Sigma R^{-3} G M
\end{equation}

(eq. 4.30 in \citealt{frank2002}), so :

\begin{equation}
t_{th} \sim \frac{c_{s}^{2}R^{3}}{G M \nu } = \frac{c_{s}^{2}}{\nu \Omega} = \frac{t_{dyn}}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

Thus if the disk were inviscid ($\nu \rightarrow 0$), then $t_{th} \rightarrow \infty$,i.e. there is no contact with adjacent disk elements. 

The cooling and heating fronts propagate through the disk at  $\alpha c_{s} $ \citep{hameury2009}  - in that description  with no viscosity there is no communication between neighboring disk annuli, and thus no front propagation \citep{balbus1998, balbus2003}. Following \cite{stern2018}, if we define as $h/R$  the the disk aspect ratio, with the disk height $h = c_{s} / \Omega$, and , the characteristic time for front propagation is:

\begin{equation}
t_{front} \sim (h/R) ^ {-1} t_{th}
\end{equation}


The viscous timescale is the characteristic time it would take for a parcel of material to undergo a radial transport due to the viscous torques from the radius $R$ to the black hole \citep{czerny2006}. Note that while the viscosity has probably magnetic origin\citep{eardley1975, grzedzielski2017}, in this simplistic order of magnitude estimate we use a hydrodynamical description of accretion flow.  With $\nu = \eta / \rho$ (kinematic viscosity being the ratio of dynamical viscosity to density), \cite{frank2002} shows (Chap.5.2) that 

\begin{equation}
t_{visc} \sim R^{2} / \nu \sim  R / v_{R} = (h/R)^{-2} t_{th}
\end{equation}

 We can parametrize each timescales for a black hole mass $M_{BH}$, at $R \sim 150 r_{g}$, with the gravitational radius $r_{g} = GM_{BH} / c^{2} \sim 4 \mathrm{au}$, using Eqs.5-8 in \cite{stern2018} : 


 \begin{equation}
 t_{dyn} \sim 10  \mathrm{days} \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}} \right) 
 \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2} 
 \end{equation}

 \begin{equation}
 t_{th}   \sim 1 \,\mathrm{year} \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1}  
 \left( \frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}}\right) \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right)^{3/2} 
 \end{equation}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  t_{front} \sim 20 \,\mathrm{years} \left( \frac{h/R}{0.05}\right)^{-1}   \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1}  \nonumber  \\ 
  \left( \frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}}\right)     \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2} 
 \end{eqnarray}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  t_{visc}  \sim 400 \, \mathrm{years} \left( \frac{h/R}{0.05}\right)^{-2}   \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1} \nonumber  \\  
  \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}} \right)     \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2}  
 \end{eqnarray}






\subsection{Alternative method to estimate black hole masses}
% Kozlowski2015 method to determine black hole masses as an alternative 
% to methods based on variability parameters. 

In an absence of time-series for a quasar, an attractive alternative method to estimate black hole masses is presented by \citep{kozlowski2015}. Broad-band AGN photometry can be translated into monochromatic fluxes in the vicinity of the reverberating lines (H$\beta$ 5100 $\mbox{\AA}$, Mg\,{\sc ii} at 3000 $\mbox{\AA}$, and C\,{\sc iv} at 1350 $\mbox{\AA}$, \citealt{kozlowski2015}), which in turn can be used to estimate the virial black hole mass :

\begin{equation}
M_{BH} = \frac{f R \Delta V^{2}}{G}
\end{equation}

where $f$ is a constant of order unity, $R$ is the size of the Broad Line Region (estimated from  emission-line lag $\Delta t$ as $R = c \Delta t$), $\Delta V$ is the emission line width, $G$ gravitational constant. From reverberation mapping studies we know that continuum luminosity $L$ is related to the size of the BLR region as $R \propto L^{\gamma}$ \citep{vestergaard2006}, with $\gamma$ very close to $1/2$ (eg. \citealt{bentz2009} finds from RM studies $\gamma = 0.519 \pm 0.06$). Thus we obtain  that $R \Delta V^{2} \propto L^{\gamma} \Delta V^{2} \equiv \mu$ , and the black hole mass is a simple function of line width measurement  and continuum luminosity : 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RMBHmass}
\log{M_{BH}} = \log{\mu} + a 
\end{equation}

This is also seen eg. in more recent study by \citep{shen2018} of the SDSS Reverberation Mapping sample. 

Ideally one would obtain a quasar spectrum to directly measure $\Delta V$ and $L$, and use Eq.\ref{eq:RMBHmass} to estimate the black hole mass. In the era of LSST, with an order of magnitude increase in the number of known quasars, spectroscopic follow-up of all is not feasible, but as long as the broad-band photometry is available, \citep{kozlowski2015} method (also applied to SDSS Quasar Data Release 12, see \citealt{kozlowski2017b}) presents an attractive alternative to the variability-based black hole mass estimates.
