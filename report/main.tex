% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

We use the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS1, PS1) data to extend  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 quasar light curves. Combining PS1 and SDSS light curves provides 15 years baseline for 9248 quasars - 5 years longer than prior studies that used only SDSS. We fit the light curves with Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, and correlate the DRW model parameters -  asymptotic variability amplitude $SF_{\infty}$, and characteristic timescale $\tau$, with quasar physical properties - black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and redshift. We find that longer baseline allows to better constrain DRW parameters - adding PS1 data the characteristic timescale $\tau$ is a stronger function of quasar luminosity, and has a weaker dependence on the black hole mass. The variability amplitude dependence on the quasar luminosity is weaker. We make predictions for the fidelity of DRW model parameter retrieval with ZTF and LSST data.

\section{Introduction}

Quasars are variable at the asymptotic rms level of about 0.2 mag. They are distant active galactic nuclei, harboring a supermassive black hole surrounded by a hot accretion disk. Although it is agreed upon that the thermal emission from the accretion disk is the source of the majority of optical light, the detailed origin of variability has been debated for the past 50 years (\citealt{sun2018} and references therein). Some favor a thermal origin of variability \citep{kelly2013}, related to the propagation of inhomogeneities ("hot spots") in the disk \citep{dexter2011, cai2016}, others suggested magnetically elevated disks \citep{dexter2019}, or X-ray reprocessing  \citep{kubota2018}.  Indeed, it may well be that the answer involves combination of these -  as \cite{sanchez2018} suggests, perhaps short-term variability (hours-days) is linked to the changes in X-ray flux, while long-term variability (months-years) is more intrinsic to the disk \citep{edelson2015,lira2015}. Nevertheless, quasar light curves have been successfully described using the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model \citep{kelly2009, macleod2010, kozlowski2010, zu2011, kasliwal2015a}, and the DRW parameters have been linked to the physical quasar properties (\citealt{macleod2010}, hereafter M10). 

Variability is also a classification tool, allowing to distinguish quasars from other variable sources that do not exhibit a stochastic variability pattern \citep{macleod2011}. This property is especially useful for selecting quasars in the intermediate redshift range, which overlaps the stellar locus in color-color diagrams \citep{sesar2007, yang2017}). Variability has also been used to increase the completeness in measurements of Quasar Luminosity Function (see \citealt{ ross2013, palanque2013, alsayyad2016, mcgreer2013, mcgreer2018}). 

Quasar, or more broadly speaking - AGN variability, has been successfully described by the broken power spectral density of the form  $\log{(P(f))} \propto \alpha_h \log{(f)}$ at high frequencies (short timescales), and  $\log{(P(f))} \propto \alpha_l \log{(f)}$  at low frequencies (long timescales). For a pure DRW process,  $\alpha_{h}{=}-2$ and $\alpha_{l}{=}0$, so that:

\begin{equation}
P(f) = \frac{4\sigma^{2}\tau}{1+(2 \pi \tau f)^{2}}
\end{equation}
(with $\sigma = \mathrm{SF}_{\infty} / \sqrt{2}$, $\tau$ the characteristic timescale, $f$ the frequency), so that $P(f) \propto f^{-2}$  at high frequencies $f > (2\pi \tau)^{-1}$, and levels to a constant value at lower frequencies\citep{kelly2014}. 

There is a debate in the literature about the exact shape of the quasar PSD, and of any possible  departures from the pure DRW model. Studies using quasar data from wide-field photometric surveys (OGLE, SDSS, PS1) benefit from relatively long baselines (several years), which lends focus to the low frequency part of the PSD. Overall, there is no evidence of a significant departure from DRW at long timescales (low frequencies), so that $\alpha_{l} \approx 0$ \citep{zu2013, simm2016, kozlowski2016b, caplar2017, guo2017, sun2018}. However, these ground-based surveys suffer from a sparse sampling, which can be remedied by using a space-based telescope that can carry out near-continuous observations, like the Kepler mission\citep{borucki2010}. Studies using Kepler data, that focused on a smaller number of well-sampled AGN, with short baselines (hundred days), also did not find convincing evidence of a departure of the AGN PSD from the DRW at high frequencies, so that indeed $\alpha_{h} \approx -2$ \citet{mushotzky2011,edelson2014,smith2018,aranzana2018}.  Since this work is basde on extending the SDSS light curves (studied by M10) with the PS1 data, we directly compare the results to M10. Therefore we elect to describe the quasar PSD by the DRW, to also allow better comparison of our results with M10. 






Due to its stochastic nature, the DRW process requires the light curve to be several times longer than the characteristic timescale for an unbiased parameter retrieval (\citealt{kozlowski2010, kozlowski2017a}, hereafter K17). This means that DRW parameters recovered for short (compared to the recovered timescale) light curves may be biased, which in turn affects the correlations with physical parameters (black hole mass, Eddington ratio, absolute luminosity). 

For this reason, while some studies have restricted the probed redshift range, limiting the quasar sample to where one would expect only shorter timescales based on previous studies \citep{sun2018, guo2017, kelly2013,simm2016}, some have elected not to study timescales at all \citep{sun2018,sanchez2018}, or use the timescales recovered from short light curves primarily for classification \citep{hernitschek2016}.

By extending available quasar light curves, we are able here to better recover a wider range of DRW timescales, and probe a wider range of redshifts and black hole masses. Since almost a decade ago, when M10 published their study based on SDSS Stripe 82 data, new datasets (PS1,PTF,CRTS) have become available. They can extend the quasar light curves by almost 50\%.  Indeed, \citet{li2018} combined SDSS and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data, to provide a 15 year baseline, but by using an entire SDSS footprint suffered from poor sampling and had to use ensemble structure function approach. %. However, by focusing on a large area to encompass as many quasars as possible (119,305 up to z=4.89) suffered from poor sampling which lends itself better to an ensemble structure function approach rather than direct light curve modeling. 

% Kepler :  not relevant in this context 
%On the short timescales there are Kepler-based studies, with extremely well-sampled light curves (30 min cadence) of a small number of quasars, with baselines of up to 4 years \citep{mushotzky2011, edelson2014, kasliwal2015a, kasliwal2017, smith2018, aranzana2018}. 






 Unlike previous studies, in this work, by combining SDSS and PS1 data we afford both an extended baseline (15 years), a large number (9000) of quasars, and  a good cadence (N > 60 epochs) to which we fit the DRW model. The layout of this paper is as follows: first we confirm in Section~\ref{sec:methods} that extending the quasar baseline is the most important improvement in providing unbiased estimates of the DRW model parameters (K17);  in Section~\ref{sec:data} we describe the datasets employed, and their combination onto a common photometric system;  in Section~\ref{sec:simulation} we test the improvement in DRW parameters with simulation; finally in Section~\ref{sec:results} we describe the main results analyzing correlations between physical parameters and variability, and in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize the main results. In this work we adopt a $\Lambda $CDM cosmology with $h_{0} = 0.7$ and $\Omega_{m} = 0.3 $.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{DRW as a Gaussian Process}
Damped Random Walk (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, \citealt{rasmussen2006}) can be modeled as a member of a class of Gaussian Processes (GP). Each GP is described by a mean and a kernel - a covariance function that contains a measure of correlation between two points: $x_{n}$ and $x_{m}$, separated by $\Delta t_{nm}$ (autocorrelation). For the  DRW process, the covariance  between two observations spaced by  $\Delta t_{nm}$ is: 

\begin{eqnarray}
k(\Delta t_{nm}) &=& \sigma^{2}\exp{(-\Delta t_{nm} / \tau)}  \nonumber \\
                 &=& \sigma^{2} ACF(\Delta t_{nm})\nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 

Here $\sigma^{2}$ is an amplitude of correlation decay as a function of $\Delta t_{nm}$,  while $\tau$ is the characteristic timescale over which correlation drops by $1/e$. For a DRW,  the correlation function $k(\Delta t_{nm})$ is also related to the autocorrelation function $ACF$. 

Not explicitly used in this paper, but of direct relevance to the DRW modeling, is the structure function (SF). SF can be found from the data as the root-mean-squared of  magnitude differences $\Delta m$  calculated as a function of temporal separation $\Delta t$ (we drop subscripts $n$,$m$ for brevity). SF is directly related to a DRW kernel $k(\Delta t)$:

\begin{equation}
SF(\Delta t) = SF_{\infty} (1-\exp{(-|\Delta t|/\tau)})^{1/2}
\end{equation}

For quasars SF follows approximately a power law: $SF \propto \Delta t^{\beta}$,  and it levels out for large time lags $\Delta t$ to a constant value of $SF_{\infty}$, as points in the lightcurve with large time separation cease to be correlated.   Note that $SF_\infty = \sqrt{2} \sigma$  in the above (also see \citet{macleod2012, bauer2009, graham2015a} for an overview).


\subsection{Fitting}
The likelihood for the particular value of DRW parameters given the data is evaluated with   \project{celerite}  - a fast GP solver \citep{foreman2017}. The underlying matrix algebra is similar to that used by \cite{rybicki1992, kozlowski2010},  M10. Also, as in previous work, we use a prior on DRW parameters that is  uniform  in log space :  $1 / (\sigma \tau)$. The main difference in our approach is that rather than adopting the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) as the `best-fit' value for the DRW parameters (as in \citealt{kozlowski2010}, K17, \citealt{kozlowski2016b}, M10, \citealt{macleod2011}),  we find the expectation value using the marginalized log posterior. This is advantageous because of a non-Gaussian shape of the log posterior - it if were described by a 2D Gaussian,  then the expectation value would coincide with the maximum of the log posterior.

\subsection{The impact of light curve baseline}\label{sec:baseline}

K17 reports that one cannot trust any results of DRW fitting unless the light curve length is at least ten times longer than the characteristic timescale.  We confirm that the fidelity of DRW parameter retrieval does depend on the ratio of timescale to baseline, but we find that the baseline does not have to be ten times longer to provide meaningful, rather than unconstrained, results. To revisit relations between recovered and input timescale as a function of light curve baseline, we follow K17 in setting up a simulation of 10 000  DRW light curves with fixed length (baseline) $\Delta T=8$ years, asymptotic variability amplitude of  $\mathrm{SF}_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag, SDSS or OGLE-like cadence, sampling over a range of input timescales. With fixed baseline, this spans the parameter space of $\rho = \tau / \Delta T$, $\rho \in   \{ 0.01 : 15\}$. We simulate 100 light curves at each $\rho$. 

\begin{figure*}  % code/PLOT_Fig2_George_Celerite.ipynb

\caption{Probing the parameter space of $\rho = \tau / \Delta T$, with a simulation of  10 000 light curves : 100 light curves per each of 100 $\rho$ values spaced uniformly in logarithmic space between $\rho \in   \{ 0.01 : 15\}$ . With a baseline $\Delta T$ set to 8 years,  we sample a range of 100 input timescales. Left panel shows the SDSS-like cadence with N=60 epochs, and the right panel the OGLE-like cadence with N=445 epochs. The dotted horizontal and solid vertical lines represent $\rho = 0.1$, i.e. the baseline is ten times longer than considered timescale. The diagonal line is $y=x$, i.e. the line that would be followed if the recovered  $\rho$ ($\tau$) was exactly the same as the input $\rho$ ($\tau$). Given a quasar light curve, which has one true underlying DRW timescale,  as we extend the baseline, we move from the bottom-left (unconstrained) to the top-right (well-constrained) part of the parameter space. } 
\label{fig:rho_space}
\end{figure*}


The true underlying DRW signal $s(t)$ is found by iterating over the array of time steps $t$.  At each step, we draw a point from a Gaussian distribution, for which the mean and standard deviation are re-calculated at each timestep (see eqs. A4 and A5 in \citealt{kelly2009}, as well as Sec. 2.2 in \citealt{macleod2010}). Starting at $t_{0}$, the signal is equal to the mean magnitude, $s_{0} = \langle m \rangle$. After a timestep $\Delta t_{i} = t_{i+1} - t_{i}$, the signal $s_{i+1}$ is drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(loc, stdev)$, with : 

\begin{equation}
loc = s_{i} e ^ { - r  }  + \langle m \rangle \left( 1 - e ^{ - r }\right)
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
stdev^{2} =  0.5  \, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}^{2} \left( 1 - e ^{  - 2 r  }  \right)
\end{equation}

where  $r = \Delta t_{i} / \tau$, and $\tau$ is the damping timescale.


To simulate observational conditions  we add to $s(t)$ - the true underlying signal,   $n(t)$ - a noise offset :
\begin{equation}
y(t) = s(t) + n(t) 
\end{equation}

 Like K17,  we assume $n(t)$ to be drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and width $\sigma$, that corresponds to the  photometric uncertainty.  Likewise,  we adopt SDSS S82-like cadence with N=60 epochs, or OGLE-III like cadence with N=445 epochs, and magnitude-dependent $\sigma$:  

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}}^{2} &=& 0.013^{2} + \exp{(2 (\mathrm{r_{SDSS}}-23.36))} \\
\sigma_{\mathrm{OGLE}}^{2} &=& 0.004^{2} + \exp{(1.63 (\mathrm{I_{OGLE}} - 22.55))}
\end{eqnarray}

with  $\mathrm{r_{SDSS}}=17$ mag and $\mathrm{I_{OGLE}}=18$ mag.  

Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_space} shows the recovered $\rho_{out}$ as a function of input $\rho_{in}$. We confirm the findings of K17: for short light curves, the best-fit $\tau$ becomes $\sim 1/2$ of light curve length (the `unconstrained' region, lower-left of each panel). However, as long as the light curve is several times longer than the timescale ($\rho \lessapprox 3 $), we can recover the timescale without bias (the dashed line approaches the solid diagonal line on both panels). Therefore, by extending the baseline we can move from the biased region (bottom left) to the unbiased regime (top right). This is the basis for this study,  in which we extend the baselines of quasar light curves from SDSS-only (10 years) to combined SDSS-PS1 (15 years). 



\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

We focus on the data pertaining to a 290 deg$^{2}$ region of southern sky known as Stripe 82 (S82), repeatedly observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) between 1998 and 2008. Originally aimed at supernova discovery, objects in this area were re-observed on average 60 times (see \citealt{macleod2012}, Sec. 2.2 for overview, and \citealt{annis2014} for details). Availability of well-calibrated \citep{ivezic2007}, long-baseline light curves spurred variability research (see \citealt{sesar2007}). The catalog prepared by \citet{schneider2008} as part of DR9  contains 9258 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Within  $0.5 ''$  we find matching data for 9248 quasars from  PanSTARRS (PS1) DR2 \citep{chambers2011,flewelling2018}, xxx from Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS, \citealt{drake2009}), and  xxx from Palomar Transient Factory (PTF, \citealt{rau2009}). Fig.~\ref{fig:lcExtent} illustrates the improvement in baseline coverage when combining various surveys. The width of each rectangle corresponds to the duration of each survey (survey baseline), and the height to the area covered by each survey. The lower edge of each rectangle marks the $5\sigma$ depth in the r-band (or equivalent). LSST stands out as providing the best extension of SDSS baseline,  and depth.  



\begin{figure*} % code2/Stats_simulation.ipynb 
\plotone{figs/lightcurves_extent.png}
\caption{An illustration of survey baseline, sky area covered, and depth. The width of each rectangle corresponds to the extent of light curves available (or simulated) for Stripe 82 quasars for each survey. For SDSS this means DR7; for CRTS DR2, PS1 DR2, PTF DR2, ZTF year 2018, and LSST the full 10-year survey. The lower edge of each rectangle (marked by a solid thick line) corresponds to the $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude (SDSS r, PS1 r, PTF R, ZTF r, LSST r, CRTS V). The vertical extent corresponds to the total survey area (for SDSS, up to and including DR15).  Note how PS1 and PTF extend the baseline of SDSS by approximately $50\%$, and how inclusion of LSST triples the SDSS baseline. For reference, the area covered by LSST is $25 000$ sq.deg., which corresponds to  $60\%$ of the sky. The whole sky has an area of $4\pi$ steradians (41253 sq.deg.).}
\label{fig:lcExtent}
\end{figure*} 


Combining data from different photometric standards would require applying color transformation, or photometric offsets. We first seek to combine PS1 gri,  PTF gR, and CRTS V, into a common SDSS r-band (best photometry). To this end we calculate  color terms using the SDSS standard stars catalog~\citep{ivezic2007}. Focusing on a 10\% subset of randomly chosen standard stars, we find their CRTS, PS1, and PTF matches~\footnote{CRTS from B.Sesar, priv.comm., PS1 from MAST \url{http://panstarrs.stsci.edu}, and PTF from IRSA PTF Object Catalog \url{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/})}. 

The difference  between the target (SDSS) and source (eg.PS1) photometry can be written as a function of the mean SDSS $(g-i)$ color: 

\begin{equation}
m_{\mathrm{PS1}} - m_{\mathrm{SDSS}} = f(g-i)
\end{equation}

Some authors (eg. \citealt{li2018}) allow the transformation to be a higher-order polynomial, but as Fig.~\ref{fig:quasarColors} shows, quasars occupy a relatively narrow region of $(g-i)$ color space, and we find that the linear fit is sufficient. We thus find the photometric offset between SDSS and  PS1 gri, PTF gR, and CRTS V,  as a function of SDSS g-i color (see Table~\ref{tab:offsets} for details). An example of SDSS-PS1 offsets is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:offsetsPS1}. Note that the PS1 r-band is very close to the SDSS r-band (middle panel), within  $0.01$ mag (1\% level) across the SDSS (g-i) color range. Fig.~\ref{fig:SDSS_PS1_offset_mag}  illustrates that this is also true as a function of SDSS r magnitude, all the way to $r < 20.5$. Because of that, we also combine PS1 r-band and SDSS r-band without applying any offsets. 

In selecting the most beneficial datasets to complement SDSS we also considered the error distribution. As shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:lcExtent},  PTF and CRTS are much shallower than SDSS or PS1. Therefore they would have larger photometric uncertainties for faint objects, like quasars (median 20 mag) - see Fig.~\ref{fig:combinedLCerrors}. Simulations show that due to larger errors PTF and CRTS while extending the SDSS baseline also decrease the overall quality of the light curves by making them more noisy. 

It turns out that, as we test with simulations in Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation}, the best improvement in recovery of quasar DRW parameters is obtained by utilizing only SDSS and PS1 data. This is partly due to both surveys having similar photometric depth (Fig.~\ref{fig:lcExtent}), and therefore comparable distributions of photometric uncertainties (Fig.~\ref{fig:combinedLCerrors}). Furthermore, to mitigate the problems that could arise when applying photometric transformations of PS1 g,i to SDSS r, we end up using only SDSS r and PS1 r, with no offsets applied. 


Similarly to \cite{charisi2016, suberlak2017}, we perform  light curve cleaning. Of 8516 light curves with 662 092 epochs, we remove 14 156  $5\sigma$ outliers in photometric uncertainty and magnitude space. We also perform day averaging (error weighted) when more than 1 epoch was available per night, which further reduces the number of epochs by 67 615. If combined nightly error was $<0.02$, we add in quadrature $0.01$ mag.  In the final sample there are 580 321 epochs.  % same as Sec. 2.3 Suberlak2017....

\section{Simulations : lessons learned}\label{sec:simulation}

We simulate the theoretical improvement of the DRW parameter retrieval in extended light curves. We generate long and well-sampled  `master' light curves, all with input $\tau = 575 $ days, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag (the median of S82 quasar distribution in M10), with a mean of 0.  We then subsample at real observed epochs for SDSS and PS1, and at predicted cadences for ZTF and LSST  (see Fig.~\ref{fig:simLC}). To each such simulated light curve we add a magnitude offset corresponding to the mean of each SDSS-PS1 segment. That way the magnitude distribution of simulated light curves is similar to that of the observed SDSS-PS1 data. For the LSST 10-year segment (finishing in 2031) we assumed 50 epochs per year, randomly distributed throughout the year, with the following error model:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:errorModel}
\sigma_{LSST}(m)^{2} &=& \sigma_{sys}^{2} + \sigma_{rand}^{2} \,\, \mathrm{(mag)}^{2} \\
\sigma_{rand}^{2} &=& (0.04-\gamma)x + \gamma x^{2} \nonumber \\
x &=& 10^{0.4(m-m_{5})} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

with  $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005$, $\gamma=0.039$, $m_{5} = 24.7$ (see \citealt{ivezic2019}, Sec.3.2).
For the ZTF 1-year segment (Spring 2019 ZTF DR1 including the data from 2018) we assumed 120 observations (every three nights) in $g_{\mathrm{ZTF}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{ZTF}}$, deriving the magnitude-dependent error model by plotting for ZTF standard stars in Fig.~\ref{fig:ztf_errors} best mag rms as a function of best median magnitude. We find that the LSST error model (Eq.~\ref{eq:errorModel}) with $\gamma = 0.05$, $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005 $, and $m_{5} = 20.8$ adequately describes the ZTF photometric uncertainty.

The orange `error snake' is an envelope marking the standard deviation of the fit to the data using a Gaussian process  with DRW kernel (Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation}).}

We overplot the adopted error model, with $\gamma = 0.05$, $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005 $, and $m_{5} = 20.8$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:errorModel}). Properties of ZTF photometric uncertainties are largely similar to the PTF uncertainties.}
\label{fig:ztf_errors}
\end{figure} 


To mirror observational conditions we add to the true underlying DRW signal a Gaussian noise, with variance defined by photometric uncertainties for corresponding surveys. Given the noise properties of each survey (Fig.~\ref{fig:combinedLCerrors}), we find that relatively large uncertainties of CRTS and PTF segments introduce less improvement in recovery of DRW parameters, with a  similar baseline already afforded by the PS1 data (Fig.~\ref{fig:lcExtent}).  We also checked that inclusion of ZTF data for 2018 would not significantly change our results. Using PS1 data with its excellent  deep photometry (as compared to ZTF or PTF) is the best improvement over existing SDSS results.  In the future (after more data has been assembled and re-calibrated) ZTF will help, but not as dramatically as LSST (see Figs.~\ref{fig:simLCresults1} and ~\ref{fig:simLCresults2}).  For this reason we use only SDSS-PS1 portion of quasar light curves, as the best tradeoff between adding more baseline vs introducing more uncertainty with noisy data.

We simulated 9258 `master' light curves, and  subsampled at real SDSS r-band or PS1 r-band cadence and photometric uncertainties, and simulated ZTF and LSST cadence. To simulate observing conditions, the underlying DRW signal was convolved with a Gaussian noise corresponding to epochal errors. 
From each light curve we start with SDSS segment only, and as we add more segments (PS1, ZTF, LSST), we refit for DRW model parameters with \project{celerite}. Thus
each line corresponds to a different segment of simulated  combined SDSS-PS1-ZTF-LSST light curves. As we extend the baseline the histograms shift to towards the vertical dashed line that marks the input values of $\tau, \sigma$. The improvement with the simulated first year of ZTF data is not as large as with LSST, due to significant baseline increase compared to SDSS-PS1 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:lcExtent}).}

\section{Results: variability parameters for S82 Quasars}\label{sec:results}

We extend Stripe82 quasar light curves by combining the SDSS r-band data with  the $r_{\mathrm{PS1}}$ data, without any photometric offets. For each quasar we fit the SDSS and SDSS-PS1 segments  with the DRW model. This yields two sets of DRW parameters per quasar: $(\tau_{SDSS}, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty, SDSS})$, and $(\tau_{SDSS-PS1}, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty, SDSS-PS1})$. Because variability is inherent to the quasar, for the remaining analysis we shift all fitted timescales to quasar rest frame, and implicitly assume that the DRW timescales are considered in rest frame: $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}} = \tau_{\mathrm{OBS}} / (1+z)$.


\begin{figure} % code2/Compare_Celerite_Chelsea_real_fits.ipynb 
\plotone{figs/MacLeod2010_Fig3_restframe_NEW_.png}
\caption{Comparison of distributions of the rest-frame variability timescale $\tau_{RF}$ against the  asymptotic variability amplitude $SF_{\infty}$, for M10 SDSS r-band,  and \project{celerite} fits using  SDSS or SDSS-PS1 segments of combined S82 quasar light curves. The M10 (red, solid lines) and this work, using only SDSS (dashed, blue), overlap, as we recover the same underlying distributions. }
\label{fig:tauRF_SFinf}
\end{figure} 


In this section we first correct fitted $\tau$, $SF_{\infty}$ for wavelength dependence. Then we show consistency with M10 results,  and consider the trends between DRW parameters and physical quasar properties: black hole mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$, absolute i-band  magnitude $M_{i}$, or redshift $z$.  


\subsection{Comparison to M10}
The DRW parameters recovered with \project{celerite} are  broadly consistent with M10 - Fig.~\ref{fig:tauRF_SFinf} shows the rest-frame  $\tau$, and $SF_{\infty}$ distributions for our results for the SDSS segment (blue dashed line),  SDSS-PS1 combined light curves (green dot-dashed line), and  M10 SDSS for r-band only (red solid line). When using the same data as M10 (SDSS), our results agree. A detailed object-by-object comparison on Fig.~\ref{fig:celeriteCompare} reveals a slight offset between log-ratios of DRW parameters, which can be attributed to software differences, and cleaning process applied to SDSS-PS1 light curves.

The small offset ($<0.05 $ dex) can be attributed to software differences. See Fig.~\ref{fig:tauRF_SFinf} for a comparison of rest-frame $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ distributions. This is similar to Fig.3 in M10, except we plot only the r-band SDSS results. The right-hand panel shows the comparison in an orthogonal $K-\hat{\sigma}$  space. }

There is no major change of shape of distribution as a function of mean quasar magnitude. )

\subsection{Outliers: possible CLQSO candidates}


For the majority of quasars,  adding PS1 data strengthens the information from the SDSS segment, and decreases the bias if the reported timescale from SDSS part was not at least several times shorter than the baseline. However, studies show that about 0.1\% quasars will exhibit large variability (in excess of 0.5 mag rms - see \citealt{macleod2012}). By investigating the outliers in $\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}} $ and $\tau_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}} $ space, we find that their light curves show signs of large changes in brightness, alike that found in Changing-Look Quasars \cite{macleod2019,ruan2019, ,frederick2019,trakhtenbrot2019,shen2019,stern2018,ross2018,lawrence2018,stern2017,lamassa2015,elitzur2014}.

Large differences in timescales and variability amplitudes between SDSS and SDSS-PS1 portions imply that just based on the SDSS portion we pick up a short-term variability, and with more data it turns out that there is a much more long-term trend. Another way to study objects that could change brightness on longer timescales is to consider the difference between median SDSS and median PS1 portions of each light curve. Fig.~\ref{fig:median_offset_SDSS_PS1} shows the histograms and the cumulative distribution of differences between the medians of  SDSS and PS1 portions of each quasar light curve. The outliers in DRW parameters are also outliers in median offsets. This means that DRW fitting is also an independent way to discover the candidates for changing-look  quasars.  See Appendix~\ref{app:clqso_cands} for light curves and table with detailed information on each of the 38 quasars.

Then, the difference between $\sigma_{G}$ calculated for each portion of the light curve (defined as the difference between 75th and 25th percentile : $\sigma_{G} = 0.7413(Q_{75} - Q_{25})$ it is a robust estimate of the standard deviation of the underlying distribution). The outliers in the median offset space are also outliers in the DRW parameter space (eg. $\log{(\tau_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} /  \tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}})} > 1$   and   $\log{(\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}})}   > 0.4  )$  and $r > 20.5$ all  38 candidates have  median(SDSS)-median(PS1)  > 0.1  }
\label{fig:median_offset_SDSS_PS1}
\end{figure}







\subsection{Rest-frame Wavelength Correction}
Since quasars are located at non-negligible redshifts, the observed wavelengths (eg. through the SDSS bandpass), depending on the redshift, probe a region of shorter wavelengths in emitted spectrum: $\lambda_{obs} {=}\lambda_{RF}  (1+z)$ (see \citealt{shen2018}, Fig.7). Thus to compare variability of the same parts of the rest-frame spectrum, we need to estimate the rest-frame emission wavelength $\lambda_{RF}$, and correct for the dependence of variability parameters ($\tau, SF_{\infty}$) on $\lambda_{RF}$. Since this study only used r-band light curves, on Fig.~\ref{fig:wavelength_dependence} we illustrate the wavelength dependence of $\tau, SF_{\infty}$ with M10 SDSS $urz$ data. We overplot with red contours the new fit results using only the SDSS portion of each light curve, and with orange contours the fit results using combined SDSS-PS1 light curves. We take the center of each bandpass to approximate the  observed wavelength. That is for SDSS $urz$ bandpasses,  $\lambda_{obs} = 3520$, $6250$, $9110$ $\mbox{\AA}$, respectively. Then for each quasar the rest-frame wavelength (corresponding to the bandpass center) is estimated given its redshift:  $\lambda_{RF} = \lambda_{obs} / (1+z)$.  On top of $\tau, SF_{\infty}$ as a function of $\lambda_{RF}$ scaled to  $4000 \mbox{\AA}$, we plot a power lae dependence employed by M10:
\begin{equation}
f \propto \left( \frac{\lambda_{RF}}{4000 \mbox{\AA}} \right)^{B}
\end{equation}
with  $B=-0.479$ and $0.17$ for $SF_{\infty}$ and $\tau$, respectively. We use this relationship to shift the rest-frame $SF_{\infty}$ and $\tau$ to   $4000 \mbox{\AA}$.

\subsection{Trends with Black Hole Mass, Absolute Luminosity}

Correlations between variability parameters and the physical properties of quasars are of high utility. In the era of large synoptic surveys (ZTF, LSST), only a few percent of AGN with optical time-series will be followed up with spectroscopy \citep{ivezic2019}. A relationship where $(\tau$,$SF_{\infty}) = f(M_{i}, M_{BH})$ would allow to infer black hole masses  and luminosities for millions of quasars.

Since S82 quasars are spectroscopically-confirmed, we use estimates of quasar physical properties, such as black hole mass, or absolute luminosity $M_{i}$, from \cite{shen2011}, based on single-epoch spectra.  $M_{i}$ in that catalog is K-corrected to the redshift of 2, $M_{i}(z=2)$, which corresponds the peak of quasar activity and requires the least extrapolation from the measured i-band \citep{richards2006a}. For details, see Appendix~\ref{app:measureBHmass}.

\begin{figure*} % ../code2/Trends_quasar_properties.ipynb 
\plotone{figs/macleod2010_Fig12_Shen2011.png}
\caption{Distribution of quasars as a function of  redshift, observed i-band magnitude, absolute i-band magnitude (K-corrected to z=2), and virial black hole mass. All taken from \citep{shen2011}. }
\label{fig:quasar_properties}
\end{figure*} 

To study the correlations between fitted DRW model parameters ($\tau, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$) and quasar properties ($M_{i}$, $M_{BH}$), we first examine the intrinsic distribution of $M_{i}$, $M_{BH}$, as a function of redshift and observed i-band magnitude.  Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_properties} shows some trends, for instance the upward gradient in the top two panels reflects the selection effect that higher redshift quasars have to be brighter to be included in the magnitude-limited sample (luminosity-redshift degeneracy: see Sec.5, Fig.12 in M10, and \citealt{dong2018}). Higher redshift quasars are also more active  and have higher black hole masses due to cosmological downsizing (see \citealt{babic2007,labita2009, mclure2004}). The distribution in the lower-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_properties} is peaked at $z=2$  ($\log_{10}(1+2)=0.47$) which corresponds to the peak of quasar activity. 

Now we consider the DRW parameters, $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ (corrected for wavelength dependence), and their relation to quasar physical properties. Fig.~\ref{fig:sf_tau_bh_mass_luminosity} shows $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$  plotted as a function of $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$, and $z$. The two left-hand side panels depict strong gradients of variability amplitude with $M_{i}$,$z$ : brighter quasars have lower variability amplitude, largely independent of black hole mass.

\label{fig:sf_tau_bh_mass_luminosity}
\end{figure*} 


To investigate these relations in more detail,  we fit $f$ ( $\tau$ or $SF_{\infty}$) as a power-law function of $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$, $z$ :  


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:powlawmodel}
\log_{10}{f} = &A& + B \log_{10}\left( \lambda_{RF} / 4000 \mbox{\AA} \right) + C (M_{i} + 23) \nonumber \\
&+& D \log_{10}{\left( M_{BH} / 10^{9} M_{\odot}  \right)} 
\end{eqnarray} 

using a Bayesian linear regression method \citep{kelly2007b} that incorporates measurement uncertainties in all latent variables. 

We compare the change in retrieved fit coefficients caused by adding PS1 data to SDSS against M10 SDSS-only study. Note that M10 fitted  DRW model treating each of the 5 SDSS bands as a separate light curve, resulting in over thirty thousand values of $\tau, SF_{\infty}$ for nine thousand S82 quasars. Grouping fitted quasar parameters by band, they were correlated to quasar physical parameters with Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}. Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodShen2011} shows the posterior samples for fitting  Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel} to $f=SF_{\infty}$ for SDSS ugriz bands separately. It illustrates that each band yields a slightly different fit coefficient. M10 reported as the fit result the band-mean (red vertical dashed line), but since in this study we only use the combined r-band data, we compare our results directly to the mean of  M10 SDSS r-band (green solid vertical line). Also, Figs.~\ref{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011tau} and ~\ref{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011sf} show the posterior from MCMC draws of fitting M10 SDSS r-band (blue solid line) DRW parameters to Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}, compared to the results reported here, which use \project{celerite} DRW fits for SDSS r-band combined with PS1 r-band.

\subsection{Comparison to other studies: Eddington ratio}

Dependence of both $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ on black hole mass and quasar luminosity can be understood as a function of accretion rate, encoded in the Eddington ratio: $f_{Edd} {=} L_{Bol}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, where $L_{\mathrm{Edd}} {=} 1.26 {\times} 10^{38} (M_{\mathrm{BH}} / M_{\odot})$ erg/s \citep{shen2011}. Fig.\ref{fig:EddingtonRatio} shows the dependence of $f_{Edd}$ and $\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$ on $M_{i}$ and $M_{BH}$.  We find a power law slope of $-0.206 \pm 0.036$, consistent with  $-0.23 \pm 0.03$ reported in M10.

Open circles mark the median $SF_{\infty}$ per $f_{Edd}$ bin, with errors defined as $\sigma_{y} = 1.25  \sigma_{G}(bin) / N$, where $N$ is number of points per bin, and $\sigma_{G}$ is the robust estimate  of the standard deviation ($\sigma_{G} = 0.7413 (Q_{75}-Q_{25})$). We assume the uncertainty along $f_{Edd}$ as $\sigma_{x} = w/\sqrt{12} $, with $w$ denoting the bin width. The solid orange line is the best-fit slope:  $-0.206 \pm 0.036$ assuming a first order polynomial, with the slope uncertainty estimated from the standard deviation of the posterior samples. This value is within error bars of M10 results ($-0.23 \pm 0.03$).}
\label{fig:EddingtonRatio}
\end{figure*} 

%Additional PS1 data extending SDSS quasar light curves suggests that characteristic variability timescale is more strongly dependent on luminosity. This is consistent with \citet{sun2018}, who concluded with Structure Function analysis of their luminosity-matched quasar sample, that $\tau$ depends mostly on the bolometric luminosity. 



\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Trends with Eddington ratio}
Anticorrelation of  variability amplitude with the Eddington ratio  has a variety of possible theoretical explanations. In the thin disk theory \cite{shakura1973, frank2002, netzer2013}, radius of the emission region at given wavelength increases with the Eddington ratio, and is inversely proportional to temperature \citep{rakshit2017}. Thus a hotter disk means that the emission observed in a given bandpass is emitted from a larger radius. From causality, a smaller region can be more variable than a larger one. Therefore, a  hotter disk would be less variable at a given wavelength than a colder one, and  the variability amplitude as studied in a particular bandpass (here, SDSS r-band) would be anticorrelated with Eddington ratio \citep{fausnaugh2016,edelson2015}. 

On the other hand, in the strongly inhomogeneous disk model independent temperature fluctuations in $N$ zones drive the variability \citep{dexter2011} . In that framework the inverse trend of variability amplitude against $L/L_{Edd}$  and $L_{Bol}$  can be understood qualitatively if more luminous quasars also have higher mass accretion rate, and thus greater number of disk inhomogeneities, resulting in smaller flux variability \citep{simm2016}. The inhomogeneous disk model was consistent with mean SDSS spectral analysis in \citet{ruan2014}, but was not a preferreed explanation for \citet{kokubo2015}. 

Both \citet{rumbaugh2018} (with Dark Energy Survey structure function study) and  \citet{sun2018}  (with a low-z subsample of S82 SDSS quasars) confirm the anti-correlation between quasar variability and luminosity. However, \citet{graham2019} do not find support for this trend with the sample extremely variable quasars (EVQs) in the CRTS dataset,  but when selecting for lower luminosity sources ($M_{V} < -23$), the anti-correlation is recovered. This is in accord with an interpretation that a dwindling fuel supply may correspond to higher variability. Furthemore, \citet{sanchez2018} combined the SDSS spectra with 5 year light curves of 2345 quasars obtained with Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST)-La Silla AGN Variability Survey, and  using the Bayesian parametrization of Structure Function \citep{schmidt2010},  SF$(\tau) = A(\tau/1 \mathrm{yr})^{\gamma} $, they also found that the amplitude of variability $A$ is anti-correlated with rest-frame emission wavelength,  and Eddington ratio (also see \citealt{simm2016}, \citealt{rakshit2017}).

Indeed, $f_{Edd}$ is a proxy for the strength of accretion, which together with orientation may be the key to explaining quasar main sequence (QMS: \citep{shen2014, marziani2018}. The QMS, defined by so-called Eigenvector-1, is the the anti-correlation between the broad line Fe{\sc ii} emission, and the strength of the narrow O{\sc iii} ($5007 \mbox{\AA}$) line \citep{wang1996}. An analysis of quasar clustering \citep{shen2014}, later confirmed by \citet{sun2015} with measurements of  black hole mass from the quasar host galaxy stellar dispersion \citep{ferrarese2000, kormendy2013}, showed that the entire diversity of quasars in  QMS can be explained by the variation in accretion (affecting $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ - the ratio of the  Fe{\sc ii} EQ  between $4435-4685$ $\mbox{\AA}$ and H$\beta$), or orientation effects (affecting the FWHM of the H$\beta$). However, \citet{panda2019a, panda2019b} found that these are insufficient, and variations in metallicity, as well as a range of cloud densities, and turbulences are required.  \cite{jiang2016} also found that metallicity, and in particular the iron opacity bump, may have a strong influence on the stability of an accretion disk, and thus linking metallicity to AGN variability. This is also consistent with findings of \cite{sun2018}: quasars with high  Fe{\sc ii} strength have higher metallicity, and have more stable disks. 



\subsection{Variability Timescales}

In the era of changing-look active galaxies ( including initially distinct classes of Changing-Look Quasars \citep{lamassa2015, macleod2019}, Changing-Look AGNs \citep{marchese2012, bianchi2009,risaliti2009}, Changing-Look LINERS \citep{frederick2019} to name a few) there is a revived interest in possibly linking the behavior of stellar-sized accreting systems (eg. Black Hole Binaries),  to that of galactic scale (eg. AGN, QSO, LINERS)\citep{noda2018, ruan2019}. 

Several relevant timescales are involved, and there are various interlinked mechanisms that could drive the variability. 

A standard optically thick, geometrically thin, $\alpha$-disk model has a hierarchy of timescales: dynamical, thermal, front, viscous, with   $t_{dyn} < t_{th} < t_{front}  < t_{visc} $ \citep{netzer2013, frank2002}. We proceed to describe briefly each timescale, concluding with our interpretation of the mechanism that could drive the variability observed from the data. 

The dynamical, or gas orbital, timescale is simply  an inverse of the Keplerian orbital angular frequency $ \Omega$  at radius R  : 

\begin{equation}
t_{dyn} {\sim}  1 / \Omega = \left( \frac{GM}{R^{3}}\right)^{-1/2}
\end{equation}


The main parameter  describing the accretion disk is $\alpha$ - the ratio of the (vertically averaged) total stress to thermal (vertically averaged) pressure \citep{lasota2016} : 

\begin{equation}
\alpha= \frac{\langle \tau_{r\varphi}  \rangle_{z} }{\langle P \rangle _{z}} 
\end{equation}


After \cite{lasota2016},  the hydrodynamical stress tensor (corresponding to  kinematic viscocity $\nu$) is:

\begin{equation}
\tau_{r\varphi } = \rho \nu \frac{\partial v_{\varphi}}{\partial R} = \rho \nu \frac{d \Omega}{d \ln{R}} = \frac{3 \rho \nu \Omega}{2}  
\end{equation}

so  with  $c_{s}$ -  local sound speed at radius $R$ (isothermal sound speed is $c_{s} = \sqrt{P/\rho}$),

\begin{equation}
\alpha  =   \frac{3 \rho \nu \Omega}{2 P} =  \frac{3 \Omega \nu}{2 c_{s}^{2}}
\end{equation}



This means that smaller $\alpha$ corresponds to less viscous disks. 


The thermal timescale, related to the time needed for re-adjustment to the thermal equilibrium (derived in detail in \cite{frank2002}), is the ratio of heat content per unit disk area to dissipation rate per unit disk area: $(dE / A) / (dE/dt /  A) = dt $.  The heat content per unit volume is ${\sim} \rho k T / \mu m_{p} {\sim} \rho c_{s}^{2}$, and heat content per unit area is  ${\sim} \rho c_{s}^{2} / h {\sim} \Sigma c_{s}^{2}$. Meanwhile, the dissipation rate per unit area, $D(R)$, is 

\begin{equation}
D(R) = \frac{9}{8} \nu \Sigma R^{-3} G M
\end{equation}

(eq. 4.30 in \citealt{frank2002}), so :

\begin{equation}
t_{th} {\sim} \frac{c_{s}^{2}R^{3}}{G M \nu } = \frac{c_{s}^{2}}{\nu \Omega} = \frac{t_{dyn}}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

Thus if the disk were inviscid ($\nu \rightarrow 0$), then $t_{th}\rightarrow\infty$ i.e. there is no contact with adjacent disk elements. 

The cooling and heating fronts propagate through the disk at  $\alpha c_{s} $ \citep{hameury2009}  - in that description  with no viscosity there is no communication between neighboring disk annuli, and thus no front propagation \citep{balbus1998, balbus2003}. Following \cite{stern2018}, if we define as $h/R$  the the disk aspect ratio, with the disk height $h = c_{s} / \Omega$, the characteristic time for front propagation is:

\begin{equation}
t_{front} {\sim} (h/R) ^ {-1} t_{th}
\end{equation}


The viscous timescale is the characteristic time it would take for a parcel of material to undergo a radial transport due to the viscous torques from the radius $R$ to the black hole \citep{czerny2006}. Note that while viscosity has probably magnetic origin \citep{eardley1975, grzedzielski2017}, in this simplistic order of magnitude estimate we use a hydrodynamical description of accretion flow.  With $\nu = \eta / \rho$ (kinematic viscosity being the ratio of dynamical viscosity to density), \cite{frank2002} shows (Chap.5.2) that 

\begin{equation}
t_{visc} {\sim} R^{2} / \nu {\sim}  R / v_{R} = (h/R)^{-2} t_{th}
\end{equation}

 We can parametrize each timescale for a black hole mass $M_{BH} = 10^{8} M_{\odot}$, at $R {\sim} 150 r_{g}$, with the gravitational radius $r_{g} = GM_{BH} / c^{2} {\sim} 4 \mathrm{au}$, using Eqs.5-8 in \cite{stern2018} : 


 \begin{equation}
 t_{dyn} {\sim} 10  \mathrm{days} \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}} \right) 
 \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2} 
 \end{equation}

 \begin{equation}
 t_{th}   {\sim} 1 \,\mathrm{year} \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1}  
 \left( \frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}}\right) \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right)^{3/2} 
 \end{equation}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  t_{front} {\sim} 20 \,\mathrm{years} \left( \frac{h/R}{0.05}\right)^{-1}   \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1}  \nonumber  \\ 
  \left( \frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}}\right)     \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2} 
 \end{eqnarray}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  t_{visc}  {\sim} 400 \, \mathrm{years} \left( \frac{h/R}{0.05}\right)^{-2}   \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1} \nonumber  \\  
  \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}} \right)     \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2}  
 \end{eqnarray}


In summary,  of  considered timescales only thermal and dynamical are short enough to be related to  the observed short-term stochastic variability. It may be that the variability on the scale of days is driven by local changes, and on the longer scale (perhaps hundreds of days) by a different mechanism \citep{kokubo2015}. The other time scales may be more related to the dramatic changes in brightness of the continuum as observed in changing-look AGN. Indeed, \citet{noda2018} favor a change in mass accretion rate, followed by a propagation of the cooling front \cite{lawrence2018, simm2016}. \citet{noda2018} also suggests that perhaps some short-term variability could be related to the amount of the disk swept by the thermal front propagation due to Hydrogen ionization instability, similarly to white dwarf systems (also, see \citealt{ruan2019, ross2018, sniegowska2019}). 


The variability on several years timescale could also be explained by the X-ray reprocessing model \cite{kokubo2015, kubota2018}, assuming that the AGN UV-optical variability is a results of reprocessing of X-ray or far-UV emission \citep{krolik1991}.  The idea of X-ray reprocessing  over time has gained more and more support, with evidence from simultaneous X-ray-UV-optical AGN time series \citep{edelson2014, mchardy2018,  zhu2018}. In particular, the accretion disk blackbody emission is insufficient to explain the broadband AGN spectrum. The total SED with a soft X-ray excess, and a hard X-ray tail, requires additional sources of emission \citep{kubota2018}. A novel model by \citet{kubota2018} divides the flow into blackbody emission, warm Comptonization region (the disk), and hard X-ray hot Comptonization component (corona, or a hot material filling the region close to the black hole below the truncation radius).  Since the soft X-rays are correlated with the hard X-rays, at least part of the picture consists of reflection or reprocessing of hard X-rays by the disk \citep{lawrence2018}. This model predicts an increase of variability amplitude ($SF_{\infty}$) with $M_{BH}$, and adds an insight that the observed slope is due to changes in accretion rate $\dot{m}$, explaining that smaller $\dot{m}$ corresponds to highest variability. This qualitatively agrees with the picture that dwindling fuel supply makes the flow more variable. Previous worries about X-ray reprocessing concerned the seemingly insufficient solid angle subtended by the source of the hard X-rays to cause the observed soft X-ray and optical response. This is addressed by realizing that reprocessing could be taking place in the extended region \citep{gardner2017}, such as an inflated inner disk (corresponding to warm Comptonizing region in \citet{kubota2018}), or even the BLR region serving as an additional 'complex reprocessor'\citep{mchardy2018}. Also, for \citet{panda2019a} warm corona helps decrease the dependence of $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ on $f_{Edd}$. 

Thus while CLAGN may be related to the state-change to ADAF flow \citep{sniegowska2019} similar to that of XRBs \citep{noda2018,ruan2019}, with cooling and heating fronts \citep{ross2018}, the more short-timescale variability requires approximately three distinct emission regions \citep{kubota2018}, with extended reprocessor (diffuse, hot, puffed-up inner disk, and BLR - \citealt{mchardy2018}), that reverberates the rapid hard X-ray variability in soft X-rays to optical via UV \citep{fausnaugh2018}. Some emission (especially soft X-rays) seems to require the warm Comptonizing corona \citet{kubota2018}. The warm corona, coupled with metallicity changes, and variation in turbulence level and cloud density, also helps explain the Quasar Main Sequence in the optical \citep{panda2019a,panda2019b}. Finally, the \citet{kubota2018} model, apart from being consistent with other mechanisms \citep{mchardy2018, panda2019a, sniegowska2019, lawrence2018, ross2018, ruan2019}, explains the observed correlation of variability amplitude with black hole mass as corresponding to variations in mass accretion rate. 




\section{Summary and Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We model ${\sim} 9000$ Stripe82 quasars as the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model with Gaussian Processes implemented in \project{celerite}.  We show that by extending the SDSS light curves with PS1 data we can improve on the recovery of the  DRW parameters: characteristic timescale $\tau$ and asymptotic variability amplitude $SF_{\infty}$. We find that these correlate with black hole mass $M_{BH}$ and absolute i-band magnitude $M_{i}$, with $\tau$ more dependent on $M_{i}$ and less on $M_{BH}$ than in M10. $SF_{\infty}$ is less strongly driven by $M_{i}$ and $M_{BH}$ than M10 found, and has a stronger, almost inverse, dependence on the Eddington ratio $f_{Edd}$. This is consistent with lower mass accretion rate corresponding to higher variability, so that when the supply of fuel decreases, the flow becomes less stable, more clumpy, more inhomogeneous.  This is also consistent with the X-ray reprocessing model, whereby the hard X-ray variability of the inner disk is reflected/reprocessed by the extended warm Comptonization region (inflated disk), and perhaps a complex reprocessor, including the clouds of the broad line region. Changes on recovered timescales are too fast to be driven by changes in disk viscosity, or thermal front propagation alone - thermal or dynamical timescale of response to the changes in X-ray emission seems most consistent with our results.



% perhaps skip, about the impact of PSD shape on the RM studies  .... 
%The exact shape of quasar PSD would affect other areas of study. One example is reverberation mapping (RM), which was used to provide  accurate black hole mass estimates. RM is based on measuring the lags between light curves observed at different wavelengths. The two most widely used approaches to measuring interband lags are interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF, \citealt{gaskell1987, peterson2004})  and  light curve modeling via Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (JAVELIN, \citealt{zu2011}). The PSD of the DRW comes explicitly in the latter,  which assumes that the higher energies drive lower energies (whether due to x-ray reprocessing or other mechanism), and that the driving light curve is well-modeled by a DRW (with PSD equal to  $-2$ or flatter).  In this scenario other light curves (at longer wavelength) are related to it via transfer function \cite{edelson2019}. Using a wrong PSD means at best that errors are underestimated. Therefore a convincing detection of a departure of quasar PSD from that of the DRW  would have  a direct impact on RM studies that use  JAVELIN or other light curve modeling tools. 



More data extending the light curves would help improve the fit coefficients, decreasing the scatter in observed correlations. Given that the uncertainty in black hole mass is one of the biggest sources of error, better measurements of quasar properties would be of high utility.  This will be possible by the upcoming AGN reverberation mapping campaigns (SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper, \citealt{kollmeier2017}), providing better calibration for line width-based methods of estimating black hole masses. All quasars in this study were spectroscopically confirmed, but some spectra had low signal-to-noise, resulting in higher likelihood of incorrect redshift measurement. Better spectroscopy and follow up of S82 quasars, afforded by SDSS-V panoptic spectroscopy, would not only help improve on the spectrum-based  properties (redshift, absolute magnitude, black hole masses), but also allow to study spectral changes, and further new CL
AGN discoveries. 

If this study were to be expanded onto a sample of quasars with good photometry over sufficiently long baselines, but lacking spectral information, the required physical information on quasars could be obtained by indirect methods of estimating the coarse spectral information from broad-band photometry. This would benefit from better catalogs of existing spectroscopically-confirmed quasars to improve the calibration, as well as better methods of estimating the redshift based on photometry alone (photo-z). 

 This will be possible in short term with the ZTF, and in the long term with LSST. Occasional coverage adding few epochs to some quasars may be possible with other surveys (eg. TESS), but to improve the statistics an entire sample of S82 quasars would require longer baselines.

\section{Measuring Quasar properties} 
\label{app:measureBHmass}
In this work we employ black hole masses, bolometric luminosities, and K-corrections from \cite{shen2011} catalog, based on single-epoch SDSS spectra. Here we explain the choices made in the difficult art of estimating each of these quasar physical properties.

It is non-trivial to measure the mass of black holes living in the centers of active galaxies, even provided a detailed spectrum. The most common  approach to estimate black hole masses in AGN is to assume that the broad-line region (BLR) is virialized:


\begin{equation}
M_{BH} = f \frac{ R\Delta V^{2} }{G} = f M_{vir}
\end{equation}


where $f$ is a constant of order unity, $R$ is the size of the BLR (estimated from  emission-line lag $\Delta t$ as $R = c \Delta t$), $\Delta V$ is virial velocity, $G$ gravitational constant \citep{shen2008}.  From reverberation mapping studies (eg. \citealt{shen2018}) we know that continuum luminosity $L$ is related to the size of the BLR region as $R \propto L^{\gamma}$ \citep{vestergaard2006}, with $\gamma$ very close to $1/2$ (eg. \citealt{bentz2009} finds from RM studies $\gamma = 0.519 \pm 0.06$). Thus we find  that $R \Delta V^{2} \propto L^{\gamma} \Delta V^{2} \equiv \mu$. The virial velocity $\Delta V$ is usually estimated from the width of the broad emission lines (or line dispersion).  In the absence of a quasar spectrum, there are alternative methods using a conversion of the broad-band photometry into monochromatic fluxes in the vicinity of reverberating lines (eg. \citealt{kozlowski2015}, used in \citealt{kozlowski2017b} to estimate black hole mass for 280 000 AGN).   
Depending on the redshift, different rest-frame calibrated emission lines shift into the observed passband: broad H$\alpha$ at  $6562\mbox{\AA}$, H$\beta$ at  $5100 \mbox{\AA}$, Mg\,{\sc ii} at $3000\mbox{\AA}$, and C\,{\sc iv} at $1350\mbox{\AA}$ (see Fig.7 in \citealt{shen2018}, and \citealt{vestergaard2002}). Some authors even consider separately C\,{\sc iv}-based and  Mg\,{\sc ii}-based  black hole mass estimates. We refer the reader to \citet{shen2008} who in detail describes various biases and inherent assumptions of virial black hole mass measurements. 



Another important quasar property - bolometric luminosity, is most often estimated from the absolute i-band magnitude, $M_{i}$ (see \citealt{shen2008}, Fig.2). $M_{i}$ is derived from the observed i-band magnitude, by correcting for Galactic extinction, and correcting for the fact that at different redshifts different portions of the spectral energy distribution are observed by the telescope filter bandpass. The latter, known as K-correction $K(z)$ \citep{oke1968},  is defined as $m_{intrinsic} = m_{observed} - K(z)$. In the early 2000`s the common approach was to K-correct to redshift 0, but as \citep{richards2006a} pointed out, since the distribution of quasars peaks at redshift 2, for most quasars correcting to the redshift of 0 required shifting the observed spectrum into the far infrared. Moreover, the procedure was to correct separately for the continuum and emission line contributions, assuming a particular spectral shape (eg. power law  $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=-0.5$ - see \citealt{schneider2010, vandenberk2001, richards2006a}).  This introduces a larger error for K(z=0) than for K(z=2) if the assumed spectral shape $\alpha=-0.5$ is far from the real spectral index. In early 2010`s, after  \citealt{richards2006a, wisotzki2000, blanton2003},  the practice started shifting towards K-correcting to redshift 2,  and including custom qusasar spectral shapes, as reflected by the content of \cite{shen2011} quasar catalog. Thus in this study we use  the absolute i-band magnitude K-corrected to z=2: $M_{i}(z=2)$. % from \citep{shen2011}. 



These methods were used to create catalogs of quasar properties derived from spectra. Since quasars are variable at ${\sim}0.2$ mag level, the ideal is to use a single-epoch calibrated spectrum to estimate the continuum luminosity, and find virial black hole masses using relationships based on the monochromatic fluxes and broad line widths described above. A glance at the available quasar catalogs reveals that, given any SDSS data release, there is indeed first a catalog of basic quasar properties (redshift and photometry - eg. \citealt{schneider2007, schneider2010}), and more detailed catalogs containing black hole masses and bolometric luminosities  follow (eg. \citealt{shen2008, shen2011}). More recently, once SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog \citep{paris2017} was released,  \citealt{kozlowski2017a} followed using SDSS photometry as a proxy for monochromatic luminosities. \citet{chen2018} added a detailed analysis of continuum luminosities in the  H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ regions for low-redshift quasars. Using the spectra from Chinese LAMOST survey \citet{dong2018} also sought to estimate virial black hole masses, and the results, while consistent with \citet{shen2011}, suffered from the necessity to peg the non-calibrated spectra to the SDSS photometry which was taken  a different epoch. Thus even though the SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog of \cite{paris2018}  is the most recent, like \citet{paris2017} it lacks black hole masses and bolometric luminosities, and there is no recent work that re-analyzed the spectral data. Therefore we use black hole mass estimates and monochromatic luminosities from \citet{shen2011}, based directly on single-epoch spectra.
