% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

We use the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS1, PS1) data to extend  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 quasar light curves. Combining PS1 and SDSS light curves provides 15 years baseline for 9248 quasars - 5 years longer than prior studies that used only SDSS. We fit the light curves with Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, and correlate the DRW model parameters -  asymptotic variability amplitude SF$_{\infty}$, and characteristic timescale $\tau$, with quasar physical properties - black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and redshift. Using simulated light curves, we find that longer baseline allows us to better constrain DRW parameters. After adding PS1 data, the variability amplitude is a stronger function of the black hole mass, and has a weaker dependence on quasar luminosity. In addition, tje characteristic timescale $\tau$ dependence on quasar luminosity is marginally weaker. We also make predictions for the fidelity of DRW model parameter retrieval when light curves will be further extended with ZTF and LSST data. Finally, we show how updated DRW parameters lend an independent method of discovering Changing-Look Quasar Candidates (CLQSO). The candidates are outliers in terms of differences in magnitude and scatter between SDSS and PS1 segments. We identify 38 objects (33 newly reported) with tenfold increase in variability timescale between SDSS and SDSS-PS1 data, which is due to a large change in brightness (over 0.5 mag) - a characteristic for CLQSO.

\section{Introduction}

Quasars are variable at rest-frame optical wavelengths at the asymptotic root-mean-square (rms) level of about 0.2 mag. These distant galaxies harbor an actively accreting supermassive black hole - an active galactic nucleus. Although it is agreed upon that the majority of optical light originates from the thermal emission of the accretion disk, the detailed origin of variability has been debated for the past 50 years (see \citealt{sun2018} and references therein). Some favor a thermal origin of variability \citep{kelly2013}, related to the propagation of inhomogeneities (`hot spots') in the disk \citep{dexter2011, cai2016}, others suggested magnetically elevated disks \citep{dexter2019}, or X-ray reprocessing  \citep{kubota2018}.  Indeed, it may well be that the answer involves combination of these -  as \cite{sanchez2018} suggests, perhaps short-term variability (hours-days) is linked to the changes in X-ray flux, while long-term variability (months-years) is more intrinsic to the disk \citep{edelson2015,lira2015}. Nevertheless, quasar optical light curves have been successfully described using the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model \citep{kelly2009, macleod2010, kozlowski2010, zu2011, kasliwal2015a}, and the DRW parameters have been linked to the physical quasar properties (\citealt{macleod2010}, hereafter M10). 

Variability is also a classification tool, allowing to distinguish quasars from other variable sources that do not exhibit a stochastic variability pattern \citep{macleod2011}. This property is especially useful for selecting quasars in the intermediate redshift range, which overlaps the stellar locus in color-color diagrams \citep{sesar2007, yang2017}). Variability has also been used to increase the completeness in measurements of Quasar Luminosity Function (see \citealt{ ross2013, palanque2013, alsayyad2016, mcgreer2013, mcgreer2018}). 

Power spectral density (PSD) informs us about the distribution of variability across frequency range: from short timescales (high frequencies) to long timescales (low frequencies). Quasar, or more broadly speaking, AGN variability, exhibits a broken power law PSD, of the form 
$\log{P(f)} \propto \alpha \log{(f)}$, with $\alpha_l$ at low frequencies and $\alpha_h$ at high frequencies. For a pure DRW process,  $\alpha_{h}{=}-2$ and $\alpha_{l}{=}0$, so that:

\begin{equation}
P(f) = \frac{4\sigma^{2}\tau}{1+(2 \pi \tau f)^{2}}
\end{equation}
(with $\sigma = \mathrm{SF}_{\infty} / \sqrt{2}$, $\tau$ the characteristic timescale, $f$ the frequency), where $P(f) \propto f^{-2}$  at high frequencies $f > (2\pi \tau)^{-1}$, and levels to a constant value at lower frequencies ~\citep{kelly2014}. 

There is a debate in the literature about the exact shape of the quasar PSD, and of any possible  departures from the pure DRW model. Studies using quasar data from wide-field photometric surveys (OGLE, SDSS, PS1) benefit from relatively long baselines (several years), which constrain the low frequency part of the PSD. Overall, there is no evidence of a significant departure from DRW at these long timescales, i.e. $\alpha_{l} \approx 0$ \citep{zu2013, simm2016, kozlowski2016b, caplar2017, guo2017, sun2018}. However, these ground-based surveys suffer from a sparse sampling, which can be remedied by using a space-based telescope that can carry out near-continuous observations, like the Kepler mission ~\citep{borucki2010}. Studies using Kepler data, that focused on a smaller number of well-sampled AGN with short baselines (<hundred days), found a range of power-law slopes at high frequencies - from -1 to -3.2, which includes the DRW $\alpha_{h} \approx -2$, but further study is needed \citep{mushotzky2011,edelson2014,aranzana2018,smith2018}. However, in this paper the timescales probed are larger than several days, and thus we can assume that DRW is the best working description of quasar variability for available optical light curves. Furthermore, in this work we directly compare the results of SDSS light curves extended with PS1 to M10 who used pure DRW description (see discussion therein on a possible departure from DRW). Therefore, to allow a better comparison of our results with M10, we  use the DRW description of quasar PSD. 

Due to its stochastic nature, for an unbiased parameter retrieval of DRW process the light curve is requird to be several times longer than the characteristic timescale (\citealt{kozlowski2010, kozlowski2017a}, hereafter K17). This means that DRW parameters recovered for short light curves (compared to the recovered timescale) may be biased, which in turn affects the correlations with physical parameters (black hole mass, Eddington ratio, absolute luminosity). 

For this reason, while some studies have restricted the probed redshift range, limiting the quasar sample to where one would expect only shorter timescales based on previous studies \citep{sun2018, guo2017, kelly2013,simm2016}, some have elected not to study timescales at all \citep{sun2018,sanchez2018}, or use the timescales recovered from short light curves primarily for classification \citep{hernitschek2016}.

By extending available quasar light curves, we are able to better recover DRW timescales. Since almost a decade ago, when M10 published their study based on SDSS Stripe 82 data, new datasets (PS1,PTF,CRTS) have become available. They can extend the quasar light curves by almost 50\%.  Indeed, \citet{li2018} combined SDSS and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data, to provide a 15 year baseline, but by using the entire SDSS footprint suffered from poor sampling and had to use the ensemble structure function approach. %. However, by focusing on a large area to encompass as many quasars as possible (119,305 up to z=4.89) suffered from poor sampling which lends itself better to an ensemble structure function approach rather than direct light curve modeling. 

% Kepler :  not relevant in this context 
%On the short timescales there are Kepler-based studies, with extremely well-sampled light curves (30 min cadence) of a small number of quasars, with baselines of up to 4 years \citep{mushotzky2011, edelson2014, kasliwal2015a, kasliwal2017, smith2018, aranzana2018}. 

 Unlike previous studies, in this work, by combining SDSS and PS1 data for the well-observed Stripe 82, we afford both an extended baseline (15 years), a large number (9000) of quasars, and  a good cadence (N > 60 epochs) to which we fit the DRW model. The layout of this paper is as follows: first we confirm in Section~\ref{sec:methods} that extending the quasar baseline is an important improvement in providing unbiased estimates of the DRW model parameters (K17);  in Section~\ref{sec:data} we describe the datasets employed, and their combination onto a common photometric system;  in Section~\ref{sec:simulation} we simulate the improvement in the recovery of DRW parameters with baseline extension and realistic cadence; finally in Section~\ref{sec:results} we describe the main results analyzing correlations between physical parameters and variability, in Section~\ref{sec:discussion} we discuss the physical meaning of relevant timescales, and in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize the main conclusions. In this work we adopt a $\Lambda $CDM cosmology with $h_{0} = 0.7$ and $\Omega_{m} = 0.3 $.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{DRW as a Gaussian Process}
Damped Random Walk (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, \citealt{rasmussen2006}) can be modeled as a member of a class of Gaussian Processes (GP). Each GP is described by a mean and a kernel - a covariance function that contains a measure of correlation between two points: $x_{n}$ and $x_{m}$, separated by $\Delta t_{nm}$ (autocorrelation). For the  DRW process, the covariance  between two observations spaced by  $\Delta t_{nm}$ is: 

\begin{eqnarray}
k(\Delta t_{nm}) &=& \sigma^{2}\exp{(-\Delta t_{nm} / \tau)}  \nonumber \\
                 &=& \sigma^{2} \mathrm{ACF}(\Delta t_{nm})\nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 

Here $\sigma^{2}$ is an amplitude of correlation decay as a function of $\Delta t_{nm}$,  while $\tau$ is the characteristic timescale over which correlation drops by $1/e$. For a DRW,  the correlation function $k(\Delta t_{nm})$ is also related to the autocorrelation function ACF. 

Not explicitly used in this paper, but of direct relevance to the DRW modeling, is the structure function (SF). SF can be found from the data as the root-mean-square scatter of  magnitude differences $\Delta m$  calculated as a function of temporal separation $\Delta t$ (we drop subscripts $n$,$m$ for brevity). SF is directly related to a DRW kernel $k(\Delta t)$:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{SF}(\Delta t) = \mathrm{SF}_{\infty} (1-\exp{(-|\Delta t|/\tau)})^{1/2}
\end{equation}

For quasars SF follows approximately a power law: $\mathrm{SF} \propto \Delta t^{\beta}$,  and for large time separation $\Delta t$, as epochs in the light curve cease to be correlated, it levels out to a constant value $\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$ - the asymptotic SF.  Note that above $\mathrm{SF}_\infty = \sqrt{2} \sigma$ (also see \citet{macleod2012, bauer2009, graham2015a} for an overview).


\subsection{Fitting}
We evaluate the likelihood of the DRW model with a particular set of $\tau,\sigma$ given the data with \project{celerite}  - a fast GP solver \citep{foreman2017}. The underlying matrix algebra is similar to that used by \cite{rybicki1992}, \cite{kozlowski2010}, and M10. Also, as in previous work, we use a prior on DRW parameters that is  uniform  in log space :  $1 / (\sigma \tau)$. The main difference in our approach is that rather than adopting the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) as the `best-fit' value for the DRW parameters (as in \citealt{kozlowski2010}, K17, \citealt{kozlowski2016b}, M10, \citealt{macleod2011}),  we find the expectation value of the marginalized posterior. This is advantageous because of a non-Gaussian shape of the posterior - otherwise, if the posterior was a 2D normal distribution, the expectation value would coincide with the maximum of the posterior (MAP solution). 

\subsection{The impact of light curve baseline}\label{sec:baseline}

K17 reports that one cannot trust any results of DRW fitting unless the light curve length is at least ten times longer than the characteristic timescale. In this section we revisit relationship between recovered and input timescales as a function of light curve baseline by following K17 setup. We confirm that the bias in retrieved DRW timescale depends on how many times the light curve is longer than the timescale. However, we find that the baseline does not have to be as many as ten times longer to provide meaningful, rather than unconstrained, results. Assuming fixed baseline of $\Delta T = 8$ years, we simulate 10 000 light curves, exploring 100 values of input timescales, but identical $\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}=0.2$ mag, with either SDSS ($N=60$), or OGLE-like ($N=445$) cadence. Defining $\rho$ as the ratio of input timescale to baseline, we probe a range of $\rho$ between 0.01 and 15, uniform in a logarithmic grid.



\begin{figure*}  % code/PLOT_Fig2_George_Celerite.ipynb
\plottwo{figs/celerite_SDSS_Jeff1_expectation-190208_results_celerite_R.png}{figs/celerite_OGLE_Jeff1_expectation-190208_results_celerite_R.png}
\caption{Recovery of the input DRW timescale, with baseline fixed to $\Delta T = 8$ years. We explore 100 logarithmically-spaced values of $\rho \equiv \tau / \Delta T$, simulating 100 realizations of DRW process at each $\rho$. The impact of photometric uncertainties and cadence is small in this case: the left panel (SDSS, N=60 epochs) does not significantly differ from the right panel (OGLE, N=445 epochs). The dotted horizontal and solid vertical lines mark $\rho = 0.1$, i.e. the baseline being ten times longer than the timescale. The solid diagonal line corresponds to a perfect recovery of DRW parameters (where $\rho_{in} =\rho_{out} $). For any quasar, extending its light curve  moves it towards the upper-right (well-constrained) portion of the diagram, since for a fixed $\tau_{in}$, increasing $\Delta T$ decreases $\rho$. For baselines shorter than $\tau$, best-fit $\tau$ is underestimated and becomes biased to $\Delta T /2 $. } 
\label{fig:rho_space}
\end{figure*}


For each light curve we simulate the underlying DRW signal $s(t)$ by iterating over the array of time steps $t$.  At each step, we draw a point from a Gaussian distribution, for which the mean and standard deviation are re-calculated at each timestep (see eqs. A4 and A5 in \citealt{kelly2009}, Sec. 2.2 in M10, and K17). Initially, at $t_{0}$ the signal is equal to the mean magnitude, $s_{0} = \langle m \rangle$. After a timestep $\Delta t_{i} = t_{i+1} - t_{i}$, the signal $s_{i+1}$ is drawn from  a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(loc, stdev)$, with : 

\begin{equation}
loc = s_{i} e ^ { - r  }  + \langle m \rangle \left( 1 - e ^{ - r }\right)
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
stdev^{2} =  0.5  \, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}^{2} \left( 1 - e ^{  - 2 r  }  \right)
\end{equation}

where  $r = \Delta t_{i} / \tau$, and $\tau$ is the damping timescale.


Like K17, we add to the true underlying signal with zero mean $s(t)$, a mean magnitude  ($\mathrm{r_{SDSS}}=17$ mag and $\mathrm{I_{OGLE}}=18$ mag), and calculate magnitude-dependent estimate of photometric uncertainty:

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}}^{2} &=& 0.013^{2} + \exp{[2 (\mathrm{r_{SDSS}}-23.36)]} \\
\sigma_{\mathrm{OGLE}}^{2} &=& 0.004^{2} + \exp{[1.63 (\mathrm{I_{OGLE}} - 22.55)]}
\end{eqnarray}

To simulate observational conditions  we add a Gaussian noise $n(t) = \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma(t))$:

\begin{equation}
y(t) = s(t) + n(t) 
\end{equation}

The resulting distribution of fitted timescales  as a function of input timescales, scaled by the  8 year baseline: $\rho_{out}$ vs $\rho_{in}$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_space}. We confirm the findings of K17: for short light curves, the best-fit $\tau$ becomes $\sim 1/5$ of light curve length (where $\log_{10}{(\rho_{out})} \approx -0.7$, the `unconstrained' region, lower-left of each panel). However, as long as the light curve is several times longer than the timescale ($1/\rho \gtrapprox 3, i.e. \log_{10}{(\rho)} \lessapprox 0.5$), we can recover the timescale without substantial bias (the dashed line approaches the solid diagonal line on both panels). Therefore, by extending the baseline we can move from the biased region (bottom left) to the unbiased regime (top right). This is the basis for this study,  in which we extend the baselines of quasar light curves from SDSS-only (10 years) to combined SDSS-PS1 (15 years).

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

We focus on the data pertaining to a 290 deg$^{2}$ region of the southern sky known as Stripe 82 (S82), repeatedly observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) between 1998 and 2008. Originally aimed at supernova discovery, objects in this area were re-observed on average 60 times (see \citealt{macleod2012}, Sec. 2.2 for overview, and \citealt{annis2014} for details). Availability of well-calibrated \citep{ivezic2007}, long-baseline light curves spurred variability research \citep{sesar2007}. The DR9 catalog \citep{schneider2008} contains 9258 spectroscopically confirmed quasars within S82. Within  $0.5 ''$  we find matching data for 9248 quasars from  PanSTARRS (PS1) DR2 \citep{chambers2011,flewelling2018}, 7737 from Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS, \citealt{drake2009}), and  6455 from Palomar Transient Factory (PTF, \citealt{rau2009}). Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_extent} illustrates the improvement in baseline coverage when combining various surveys. The width of each rectangle corresponds to the duration of each survey (survey baseline), and the height to the area covered by each survey. The lower edge of each rectangle marks the $5\sigma$ depth in the r-band (or equivalent). LSST stands out in that it will provide the best extension of SDSS baseline and depth.  



\begin{figure*} % code2/Stats_simulation.ipynb 
\plotone{figs/lightcurves_extent.png}
\caption{An illustration of survey baseline, sky area covered, and depth. The width of each rectangle corresponds to the extent of real or simulated light curves for Stripe 82 quasars for each survey. This includes SDSS DR7, CRTS DR2, PS1 DR2, PTF DR2, ZTF DR1, and for LSST the full 10-year survey. The lower edge of each rectangle (marked by a  thick dashed line) corresponds to the $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude (SDSS $r$, PS1 $r$, PTF $R$, ZTF $r$, LSST $r$, CRTS $V$). The vertical extent of each rectangle corresponds to the total survey area (for SDSS, up to DR15).  Note how PS1 and PTF extend the baseline of SDSS by approximately $50\%$, and how inclusion of LSST roughly triples the SDSS baseline. For reference, the area covered by LSST is $20 000$ sq.deg.}
\label{fig:lc_extent}

Combining data from different photometric standards requires applying color transformation, or photometric offsets. We first seek to combine PS1 $gri$,  PTF $gR$, and CRTS $V$, into a common SDSS $r$-band (best photometry). To this end we calculate  color terms using the SDSS standard stars catalog~\citep{ivezic2007}. Focusing on a 100 000 randomly chosen stars, we find their CRTS, PS1, and PTF matches~\footnote{CRTS from B.Sesar, priv.comm., PS1 from MAST (\url{http://panstarrs.stsci.edu}), and PTF from IRSA PTF Object Catalog (\url{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/})}. 

The difference  between the target (SDSS) and source (eg.PS1) photometry can be written as a function of the mean SDSS $g-i$ color: 

\begin{equation}
m_{\mathrm{PS1}} - m_{\mathrm{SDSS}} = f(g-i)
\end{equation}

Some authors (eg. \citealt{li2018}) allow the transformation to be a higher-order polynomial, but as Fig.~\ref{fig:quasarColors} shows, quasars occupy a relatively narrow region of $g-i$ color space, and we find that the linear fit is sufficient. The derived linear coefficients for photometric transformations between SDSS $r$ and PS1 $gri$, PTF $gR$, CRTS $V$,  as a function of SDSS $g-i$ color, are listed in Table~\ref{tab:offsets}. We illustrate the process showing in Fig.~\ref{fig:offsetsPS1} the SDSS-PS1 standard stars data used to calculate the offsets. Note that the PS1 $r$ (middle panel) is very close to the SDSS $r$ - within  $0.01$ mag (1\% level) across the $g-i$ color range. We focus on SDSS $r$ - PS1 $r$ offset as a function of magnitude in Fig.~\ref{fig:offsetPS1mag} - the near-equivalence of bandpass coverage is valid at 1\% level up to $r < 20.5$. %Because of that, we also combine PS1 r-band and SDSS r-band without applying any offsets. 

In selecting the most beneficial datasets to complement SDSS $r$ we also consider the associated photometric uncertainties (aka `errors'). As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_extent},  PTF and CRTS are shallower than SDSS or PS1. Therefore for faint objects, like quasars (for S82 sample the population median is SDSS $r \sim 20$ mag) PTF and CRTS have larger photometric uncertainties than SDSS or PS1. Indeed, as Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_errors} shows, the distribution of median errors for PTF, CRTS, and ZTF quasar data is wider than the corresponding SDSS and PS1 data. As simulations show (Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation}), although PTF and CRTS data do extend the SDSS baseline, their error properties decreases their utility in complementing the SDSS dataset. After all, the SDSS baseline extension afforded with PTF and CRTS is comparable to that achieved with PS1 data alone (Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_extent}). 

Furthermore, to mitigate problems that could arise when applying photometric transformations (such as spurious variability due to incorrect offsets, or color-dependent variability), we choose to combine SDSS $r$ with only PS1 $r$, since as Figs.~\ref{fig:offsetsPS1},~\ref{fig:offsetPS1mag} show, SDSS $r$ and PS1 $r$ are sufficiently similar (at 1\% level up to 20.5 mag) that no photometric transformation is required. 

Finally, we clean the combined SDSS $r$ - PS1 $r$ quasar light curves using standard procedures of  $\sigma$-clipping in magnitude and error space, and error-weighted day-averaging, to mitigate the impact of bad photometry, and average out the intra-night variability (as in \citealt{charisi2016,suberlak2017}). Of 9248 SDSS-PS1 quasars, 8516 have the PS1 $r$ data with 662 092 epochs.  We remove points that have error departing from median SDSS(PS1) light curve segment by more than $7 \sigma$, and we visually inspect all photometry with magnitudes departing by more than  $7\sigma$ from median magnitude. Of 585 flagged light curves, 253 required removal of flares or bad photometry, since the DRW model does not handle flares. To avoid unphysically small errors,  we add in quadrature $0.01$ mag if combined nightly error is $<0.02$ mag. In the final sample there are 580 321 epochs.

\section{Simulations : lessons learned}\label{sec:simulation}

We simulate the theoretical improvement of the DRW parameter retrieval in extended light curves. We generate long and well-sampled  `master' light curves, all with input $\tau = 575 $ days, SF$_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag (the median of S82 quasar distribution in M10), with 0 mean.  We subsample at real observed epochs for SDSS and PS1, and at predicted cadences for ZTF and LSST  (see Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_simulated}). To each simulated light curve we add a magnitude offset corresponding to the mean of the combined SDSS-PS1 light curve. That way the magnitude distribution of simulated light curves is similar to that of the observed SDSS-PS1 data. For the LSST 10-year segment (finishing in 2031) we assumed 50 randomly distributed  epochs per year, with the following error model:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:errorModel}
\sigma_{LSST}(m)^{2} &=& \sigma_{sys}^{2} + \sigma_{rand}^{2} \,\, \mathrm{(mag)}^{2} \\
\sigma_{rand}^{2} &=& (0.04-\gamma)x + \gamma x^{2} \nonumber \\
x &=& 10^{0.4(m-m_{5})} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

with  $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005$, $\gamma=0.039$, $m_{5} = 24.7$ (see \citealt{ivezic2019}, Sec. 3.2).
For the ZTF 1-year segment (Spring 2019 ZTF DR1 including the data from 2018) we assumed 120 observations (every three nights) in $g_{\mathrm{ZTF}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{ZTF}}$, deriving the magnitude-dependent error model by plotting best mag rms as a function of best median magnitude for ZTF matches to S82 standard stars in Fig.~\ref{fig:ztf_errors}. We find that the LSST error model (Eq.~\ref{eq:errorModel}) with $\gamma = 0.05$, $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005 $, and $m_{5} = 20.8$ adequately describes the ZTF photometric uncertainty.

We overplot the adopted error model, with $\gamma = 0.05$, $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005 $, and $m_{5} = 20.8$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:errorModel}). Properties of ZTF photometric uncertainties are largely similar to the PTF uncertainties.}

The orange `error snake' is an envelope marking the standard deviation of the fit to the data using a Gaussian process  with DRW kernel (Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation}).}
\label{fig:lc_simulated}
\end{figure*} 



To mirror observational conditions we add to the true underlying DRW signal a Gaussian noise, with variance defined by photometric uncertainties for corresponding surveys. Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_simulated} illustrates the simulated `master' light curve (black dots, 4 per day), subsampled at SDSS (red), PS1 (green), and LSST (blue) cadence. While PS1 provides a 50\% improvement of the SDSS baseline, LSST will nearly triple it. Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_simulated_results} shows how the simulated distribution of DRW parameters $\sigma$, $\tau$, changes as the SDSS quasar light curves are extended with PS1, ZTF, and LSST data. In the future (after more data has been assembled and re-calibrated), ZTF will help, but not as dramatically as LSST. Note that ZTF, due to larger errors (Fig.\ref{fig:lc_errors}), causes a widening of the recovered $\tau$ distribution. Using PS1 data with its excellent  deep photometry (as compared to ZTF or PTF) is the best improvement over existing SDSS results.  For this reason we use only SDSS-PS1 portion of quasar light curves, as the best tradeoff between adding more baseline vs introducing more uncertainty with noisy data.

We simulated 9258 `master' light curves, and  subsampled at real SDSS r-band or PS1 r-band cadence and photometric uncertainties, and simulated ZTF and LSST cadence. To simulate observing conditions, the underlying DRW signal was convolved with a Gaussian noise corresponding to epochal errors. 
For each light curve we start with SDSS segment only, and as we add more segments (PS1, ZTF, LSST), we refit for DRW model parameters with \project{celerite}. Thus
each distribution corresponds to a different segment of simulated  combined SDSS-PS1-ZTF-LSST light curves. Extending the baseline shifts the distribution of recovered DRW parameters towards unbiased regime - vertical dashed line marks input matching the output. This corresponds to the upper-right (well-constrained) portion of Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_space}.}

\section{Results: variability parameters for S82 Quasars}\label{sec:results}

We extend Stripe 82 quasar light curves by combining the SDSS r-band data with  the PS1 $r$-band data, without any photometric offets. For each quasar we fit the SDSS and SDSS-PS1 segments  with the DRW model. This yields two sets of DRW parameters per quasar: $(\tau_{SDSS}, \sigma_{SDSS})$, and $(\tau_{SDSS-PS1},\sigma_{SDSS-PS1})$. Because variability is inherent to the quasar, for the remaining analysis we shift all fitted timescales to quasar rest frame, and implicitly assume that the DRW timescales are considered in rest frame: $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}} = \tau_{\mathrm{OBS}} / (1+z)$.


\begin{figure} % code2/Compare_Celerite_Chelsea_real_fits.ipynb 
\plotone{figs/MacLeod2010_Fig3_restframe_NEW_.png}
\caption{Comparison of distributions of the rest-frame variability timescale $\tau_{RF}$ against the  asymptotic variability amplitude SF$_{\infty}$, for M10 SDSS r-band,  and \project{celerite} fits using  SDSS or SDSS-PS1 segments of combined S82 quasar light curves. The M10 (red, solid lines) and this work, using only SDSS (dashed, blue), overlap, as we recover the same underlying distributions. }
\label{fig:tau_sf_dist}
\end{figure} 


In this section we first correct fitted $\tau$, $\sigma$ for wavelength dependence. Then we show consistency with M10 results,  and consider the trends between DRW parameters and physical quasar properties: black hole mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$, absolute i-band  magnitude $M_{i}$, or redshift $z$.  


\subsection{Comparison to M10}
The DRW parameters recovered with \project{celerite} are  broadly consistent with M10 - Fig.~\ref{fig:tau_sf_dist} shows the rest-frame  $\tau$, and SF$_{\infty}$ distributions for our results for the SDSS segment (blue dashed contours),  SDSS-PS1 combined light curves (green dot-dashed contours), and  M10 SDSS for r-band only (red solid contours). When using exactly the same data as M10 (SDSS), our results agree. The offset of 0.05 dex  between our and M10 results for SDSS, seen on the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_tau_ratios_M10}, can be attributed to data cleaning and software differences. The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_tau_ratios_M10} shows the same distribution in terms of $K-\hat{\sigma}$ space, orthogonal to $\tau-\sigma$, where $\hat{\sigma} = \sigma\sqrt{2 / \tau}$, and $K = \tau \sqrt{\sigma} 2^{1/4} $.

The small offset ($<0.05 $ dex) can be attributed to software differences. See Fig.~\ref{fig:tau_sf_dist} for a comparison of rest-frame $\tau$ and SF$_{\infty}$ distributions. This is similar to Fig.3 in M10, except we plot only the r-band SDSS results. The right-hand panel shows the comparison in an orthogonal $K-\hat{\sigma}$  space, where $K$ is the direction along the diagonal on the left panel, and $\hat{\sigma}$-perpendicular to the diagonal. For this reason the right panel has a ten times smaller scatter along $\hat{\sigma}$ (0.037) than $K$ (0.358).}

There is no major change of shape of distribution as a function of mean quasar magnitude.

\subsection{Outliers: possible CLQSO candidates}
\label{sec:outliers}
Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_tau_ratios} shows the change in recovered DRW parameters between SDSS and combined SDSS-PS1 light curves. The distribution of $f_{\sigma} \equiv \log_{10}{(\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}})}$ and $f_{\tau} \equiv \log_{10}{(\tau_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}} )}$ for real light curves (left), matches the predicted distribution for simulated light curves (right). Studies show that about 0.1\% quasars will exhibit large variability (in excess of 0.5 mag rms - see Fig.18 in \citealt{macleod2012}). Visual inspection of light curves in the upper-right region of the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_tau_ratios} (marked by the red rectangle) reveals large changes in brightness, similar to those seen in Changing-Look Quasars
~\citep{macleod2019,ruan2019, sheng2019, frederick2019,trakhtenbrot2019,shen2019,stern2018,ross2018,lawrence2018,yang2018,gezari2017, stern2017, sheng2017, blanchard2017, ruan2016, runnoe2016, guo2016, lamassa2015,schawinski2015, elitzur2014}. The light curves and properties of 38 CLQSO candidates for which $f_{\tau} > 1$, $f_{\sigma} > 0.4$, and  $\langle r \rangle < 20.5 $ are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:clqso_cands}.

Such large differences in timescales and amplitude of variability can also be inferred directly from the light curves. Consider the difference in magnitude and scatter between the SDSS portion of the light curve (spanning approximately 10 years between 1998 and 2008), and the PS1 portion (spanning $\sim$5 years between, 2009-2014 - see Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_extent}). We measure the median magnitudes offset as $\Delta(\mathrm{median}) =  \mathrm{median}(SDSS) - \mathrm{median}(PS1)$, and the scatter difference as $\Delta(\sigma_{G}) = \sigma_{G}(SDSS)-\sigma_{G}(PS1)$. The resulting distributions of  $\Delta(\mathrm{median}) $ and $\Delta(\sigma_{G})$ for S82 quasars are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:median_offsets}. Indeed, when plotting $\Delta(\mathrm{median})$ as a function of $f_{\tau}$ and $f_{\sigma}$ there is a gradient indicating that the  CLQSO candidates - outliers in $(f_{\tau}, f_{\sigma})$ space, are also outliers in $\Delta(\mathrm{median})$- $\Delta(\sigma_{G})$ space. Thus the by-product of extending light curves to recalculate the DRW parameters with increased fidelity is an independent method to discover the CLQSO.

$\sigma_{G}$ is a robust estimate of the standard deviation, and is related to the difference between 75th and 25th percentile : $\sigma_{G} = 0.7413(Q_{75} - Q_{25})$). The outliers in the median offset space are also outliers in the DRW parameter space (eg. objects with $\log{(\tau_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} /  \tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}})} > 1$   and   $\log{(\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}})}   > 0.4  )$  and $r > 20.5$  have    $\Delta(\mathrm{median}) > 0.1$).}

\end{figure}




\subsection{Rest-frame Wavelength Correction}

Objects at cosmological distances are embedded in Hubble flow due to the expansion of the Universe~\citep{riess2019}. Therefore light observed from a distant quasar would have been emitted at shorter wavelength in quasar's rest-frame: $\lambda_{RF} = \lambda_{obs} / (1+z)$, where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. Quasars at different redshifts probe different regions of rest-frame spectra (see Fig.7 in \citealt{shen2018}). Thus before correlating the DRW parameters with quasar properties we correct $\sigma, \tau$ for the $\lambda_{RF}$ dependence, studied by M10 with SDSS $ugriz$ light curves. We plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:lambda_dependence} the DRW parameters: SF$_{\infty}$ and $\tau$, as a function of $\lambda_{RF}$. A solid line marks the M10 best-fit power law trend:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lambda}
f \propto \left( \frac{\lambda_{RF}}{4000 \mbox{\AA}} \right)^{B}
\end{equation}

with  $B=-0.479$ and $0.17$ for SF$_{\infty}$ and $\tau$, respectively.

The red line indicates the best-fit power law to M10 data, with $B=0.17$ an $-0.479$ for $\tau_{RF}$, and SF$_{\infty}$, respectively. We take the center of each bandpass to approximate the  observed wavelength: that is, for SDSS $urz$ bandpasses,  $\lambda_{obs} = 3520$, $6250$, $9110$ $\mbox{\AA}$, respectively, and given the redshift of each quasar, find $\lambda_{RF}=\lambda_{obs} / (1+z)$.}
\label{fig:lambda_dependence}
\end{figure} 




\subsection{Trends with Black Hole Mass, Absolute Luminosity}

In the era of large synoptic surveys such as ZTF or LSST, the large increase in the number of discovered quasars means that due to limited observational resources we will afford a spectroscopic follow-up for only a few percent of AGN with optical time-series~\citep{ivezic2019}. Therefore, a relationship between quasar variability parameters ($\tau, \sigma$), and physical properties $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$ could provide an estimate of the latter for millions of quasars. We inspect correlations between $\tau, \sigma$  and $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$, using \cite{shen2011} catalog, based on single-epoch SDSS spectra. $M_{i}$ is K-corrected to  $z= 2$, corresponding to the peak of quasar activity~\citep{richards2006a}. For details, see Appendix~\ref{app:measureBHmass}.

On Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_properties} we examine the distribution of $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$, as a function of $z$ for S82 quasars. The upward gradient in the top two panels reflects the selection effect that higher redshift quasars have to be brighter to be included in the magnitude-limited sample (luminosity-redshift degeneracy: see Sec.5, Fig.12 in M10, and \citealt{dong2018}). Higher redshift quasars are also more active  and have higher black hole masses due to cosmological downsizing (see \citealt{babic2007,labita2009, mclure2004}). The distribution in the lower-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_properties} is peaked at $z=2$ which corresponds to the peak of quasar activity.

Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_trends} shows the DRW parameters for S82 quasars: $\tau$ and SF$_{\infty}$, plotted as a function of quasar physical properties $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$, and $z$. Upper-left and lower-left panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_trends} contain a gradient of SF$_{\infty}$  with 
$M_{i}$,$z$ - brighter quasars have lower variability amplitude, largely independent of black hole mass.

\label{fig:quasar_trends}
\end{figure*} 


We investigate these relations in more detail by fitting $f$ ( $\tau$ or SF$_{\infty}$) as a power-law function of $M_{BH}$, $M_{i}$, $z$ :  


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:powlawmodel}
\log_{10}{f} = &A& + B \log_{10}\left( \lambda_{RF} / 4000 \mbox{\AA} \right) + C (M_{i} + 23) \nonumber \\
&+& D \log_{10}{\left( M_{BH} / 10^{9} M_{\odot}  \right)} 
\end{eqnarray} 

using a Bayesian linear regression method that incorporates measurement uncertainties in all latent variables~\citep{kelly2007b}. This ansatz is identical to that used by M10, and very similar to the relation used by \cite{scaringi2015}, since for black holes their Eq.1 becomes $\log{t_{b}} = A' \log{M_{BH}} + B' \log{L_{Bol}}+C'$ where $t_{b}$ is the PSD break timescale. 

We compare the change in retrieved fit coefficients caused by adding PS1 data to SDSS against M10 SDSS-only study. Note that M10 fitted  DRW model treating each of the 5 SDSS bands as a separate light curve, resulting in over thirty thousand values of $\tau, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$ for nine thousand S82 quasars. Grouping fitted quasar parameters by band, they were correlated to quasar physical parameters with Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}. Fig.~\ref{fig:ugriz_drw_M10} shows the posterior samples for fitting  Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel} to $f=\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$ for quasar data separately for each SDSS bandpass.  Each band yields a slightly different fit coefficient. M10 reported as the fit result the band-mean (red vertical dashed line). Since this study uses only $r$ band data, we compare the fit coefficients to M10 SDSS $r$ data (green solid vertical line in Fig.~\ref{fig:ugriz_drw_M10}). We show the results of fitting Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel} to new SDSS and SDSS-PS1 parameters in Figs.~\ref{fig:drw_tau_posterior},~\ref{fig:drw_sf_posterior}. First, with $f=\tau$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel} (Fig.~\ref{fig:drw_tau_posterior}), the SDSS-PS1 data confirms M10 for luminosity dependence (the posterior MCMC samples overlap), but the dependence of $\tau$  on $M_{BH}$  is marginally weaker (by 0.007 dex). Second, in Fig.~\ref{fig:drw_sf_posterior} with  $f=\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$, $\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$ has a slightly weaker dependence on $M_{BH}$ (by 0.04 dex compared to M10). The difference between \project{celerite} SDSS-only results and M10 can be attributed to data cleaning that was not performed by M10, and software differences. Each distribution from 
Figs.~\ref{fig:drw_tau_posterior} and ~\ref{fig:drw_sf_posterior} is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:coefficients}, with the uncertainty in A,C,D fit coefficients estimated from  the standard deviation of the posterior samples. 

We also searched for signal of Mg\,{\sc ii} variability (see \citealt{cackett2015} for a review). Mg\,{\sc ii}, like  H$\alpha$  and  H$\beta$  is a permitted low-ionization line \citep{yang2019}, but on average is being emitted by gas further away from the ionizing source than the  H$\beta$, possibly at the edge of the BLR \citep{guo2019}. \cite{ivezic2004} and \cite{macleod2012} studied the SDSS-POSS sample of quasars, and report the detection of a decrement in the data-model residuals around 2800 $\mbox{\AA}$ when plotting the residuals as a function of $\Delta t$ and $\lambda_{RF}$. We investigated the data-model residuals for $f=\mathrm{SF}_{\infty}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}. We find that using the SDSS data the decrement in the median($\tau_{\mathrm{RF}}$) around 2800 $\mbox{\AA}$ is visible at $\sim 3 \sigma$  relative to the smooth model, but adding the PS1 data the significance rises to $\sim 5 \sigma$. We do not see much difference with regards to whether using the subset of 6371 quasars for which M10 had reliable results (listed in Table~\ref{tab:coefficients}), versus  the full set of 8516 quasars fitted with Celerite for DRW parameters. The effect is interesting, but does not produce very significant signal - see Appendix~\ref{app:mgii_variability} for more details.

\subsection{Comparison to other studies: Eddington ratio}

Eddington ratio $(f_{Edd} {=} L_{Bol}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}})$ encodes accretion strength: the proximity of quasar bolometric luminosity to the theoretical Eddington limit, where $L_{\mathrm{Edd}} {=} 1.26 {\times} 10^{38} (M_{\mathrm{BH}} / M_{\odot})$ erg/s \citep{shen2011}. Since $\tau$ and SF$_{\infty}$ depend on $M_{i}$ and $M_{BH}$, we investigate the possibility of the Eddington ratio being the driver of these observed trends. On Fig.~\ref{fig:eddington_ratio} we show $f_{Edd} $ as a function of $M_{i}$, $M_{BH}$, and SF$_{\infty}$. The left two panels depict  $f_{Edd} $ and SF$_{\infty}$ binned as a function of $M_{i}$ and $M_{BH}$. Third panel shows the quasar counts, and the fourth panel the bin means (black dots). The means are further binned along  $f_{Edd} $ (as in M10). Combined SDSS-PS1 data supports SF$_{\infty}$  being inversely related to  $f_{Edd} $, with power-law slope of $-0.207 \pm 0.03$, consistent with  $-0.23 \pm 0.03$ reported by M10.

Fourth panel : the median $f_{Edd}$ and SF$_{\infty}$ per  bin are plotted as  green crosses. These are aggregated along $f_{Edd}$, in 10 bins of such  width that each has the same number of points. Open circles mark the median SF$_{\infty}$ per $f_{Edd}$ bin, with errors defined as $\sigma_{y} = 1.25  \sigma_{G}(bin) / N$, where $N$ is number of points per bin, and $\sigma_{G}$ is the robust estimate  of the standard deviation ($\sigma_{G} = 0.7413 (Q_{75}-Q_{25})$). We assume the uncertainty along $f_{Edd}$ as $\sigma_{x} = w/\sqrt{12} $, with $w$ denoting the bin width \citep{ivezic2014}. The solid orange line is the best-fit slope:  $-0.207 \pm 0.031$, with the slope uncertainty estimated from the standard deviation of the posterior samples. The best-fit slope agrees with M10 results ($-0.23 \pm 0.03$), plotted as dashed magenta line.}

\end{figure*} 

%Additional PS1 data extending SDSS quasar light curves suggests that characteristic variability timescale is more strongly dependent on luminosity. This is consistent with \citet{sun2018}, who concluded with Structure Function analysis of their luminosity-matched quasar sample, that $\tau$ depends mostly on the bolometric luminosity.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Trends with Eddington ratio}
Anticorrelation of  variability amplitude with Eddington ratio  has a variety of possible theoretical explanations. In the thin disk theory \citep{shakura1973, frank2002, netzer2013}, radius of the emission region at given wavelength increases with Eddington ratio, and is inversely proportional to temperature \citep{rakshit2017}. Thus a hotter disk means that the emission observed in a given bandpass is emitted from a larger radius. From causality, a smaller region can be more variable than a larger one. Therefore, a  hotter disk would be less variable at a given wavelength than a colder one, and  the variability amplitude as studied in a particular bandpass (here, SDSS r-band) would be anticorrelated with Eddington ratio \citep{fausnaugh2016,edelson2015}. 

On the other hand, in the strongly inhomogeneous disk model independent temperature fluctuations in $N$ zones drive the variability \citep{dexter2011}. In that framework the inverse trend of variability amplitude against $L/L_{Edd}$  and $L_{Bol}$  can be understood qualitatively if more luminous quasars also have higher mass accretion rate, and thus greater number of disk inhomogeneities, resulting in smaller flux variability \citep{simm2016}. The inhomogeneous disk model was consistent with mean SDSS spectral analysis in \citet{ruan2014}, but was not a preferreed explanation for \citet{kokubo2015}. 

Both \citet{rumbaugh2018} (with Dark Energy Survey structure function study) and  \citet{sun2018}  (with a low-z subsample of S82 SDSS quasars) confirm the anti-correlation between quasar variability and luminosity. However, \citet{graham2019} do not find support for this trend with the sample of extremely variable quasars (EVQs) in the CRTS dataset,  but when selecting for lower luminosity sources ($M_{V} < -23$), the anti-correlation is recovered. This agrees with an interpretation that a dwindling fuel supply may correspond to higher variability. Furthermore, \citet{sanchez2018} combined the SDSS spectra with 5 year light curves of 2345 quasars obtained with Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST)-La Silla AGN Variability Survey, and  using the Bayesian parametrization of Structure Function \citep{schmidt2010} they also found that the amplitude of variability $A$ is anti-correlated with rest-frame emission wavelength,  and Eddington ratio (also see \citealt{simm2016}, \citealt{rakshit2017}).

Indeed, $f_{Edd}$ is a proxy for the strength of accretion, which together with orientation may be the key to explaining quasar main sequence (QMS: \citealt{shen2014, marziani2018}). The QMS, defined by so-called Eigenvector-1, is the anti-correlation between the broad line Fe{\sc ii} emission, and the strength of the narrow O{\sc iii} ($5007$ $\mbox{\AA}$) line \citep{wang1996}. An analysis of quasar clustering by \citet{shen2014}, later confirmed by \citet{sun2015} with measurements of  black hole mass from the quasar host galaxy stellar dispersion \citep{ferrarese2000, kormendy2013}, showed that the entire diversity of quasars in  QMS can be explained by the variation in accretion (affecting $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ - the ratio of the  Fe{\sc ii} EQ  between $4435-4685$ $\mbox{\AA}$ and H$\beta$), or orientation effects (affecting the FWHM of the H$\beta$). However, \citet{panda2019a, panda2019b} found that these are insufficient, and variations in metallicity, as well as a range of cloud densities, and turbulences are required.  \cite{jiang2016} also found that metallicity, and in particular the iron opacity bump, may have a strong influence on the stability of an accretion disk, and thus linking metallicity to AGN variability. This is also consistent with findings of \cite{sun2018}: quasars with high  Fe{\sc ii} strength have higher metallicity, and have more stable disks. 


\subsection{Variability Timescales}

In the era of changing-look active galaxies (including initially distinct classes of Changing-Look Quasars \citep{lamassa2015, macleod2019}, Changing-Look AGNs \citep{marchese2012, bianchi2009,risaliti2009}, Changing-Look LINERS \citep{frederick2019} to name a few) there is a revived interest in possibly linking the behavior of stellar-sized accreting systems (eg. Black Hole Binaries),  to that of galactic scale (eg. AGN, QSO, LINERS  - \citealt{noda2018, ruan2019}). 

Several relevant timescales are involved, and there are various interlinked mechanisms that could drive the variability. A standard optically thick, geometrically thin, $\alpha$-disk model has a hierarchy of timescales: dynamical, thermal, front, viscous, with   $t_{dyn} < t_{th} < t_{front}  < t_{visc} $ \citep{netzer2013, frank2002}. We proceed to describe briefly each timescale, concluding with our interpretation of the mechanism that could drive the variability observed from the data. 

The dynamical, or gas orbital, timescale is simply  an inverse of the Keplerian orbital angular frequency $ \Omega$  at radius $R$: 

\begin{equation}
t_{dyn} {\sim}  1 / \Omega = \left( \frac{GM}{R^{3}}\right)^{-1/2}
\end{equation}


The main parameter  describing the accretion disk is $\alpha$ - the ratio of the (vertically averaged) total stress to thermal (vertically averaged) pressure: 

\begin{equation}
\alpha= \frac{\langle \tau_{r\varphi}  \rangle_{z} }{\langle P \rangle _{z}} 
\end{equation}


After \cite{lasota2016},  the hydrodynamical stress tensor (corresponding to  kinematic viscocity $\nu$) is:

\begin{equation}
\tau_{r\varphi } = \rho \nu \frac{\partial v_{\varphi}}{\partial R} = \rho \nu \frac{d \Omega}{d \ln{R}} = \frac{3 \rho \nu \Omega}{2}  
\end{equation}

so  with  $c_{s}$ -  local sound speed at radius $R$ (isothermal sound speed is $c_{s} = \sqrt{P/\rho}$),

\begin{equation}
\alpha  =   \frac{3 \rho \nu \Omega}{2 P} =  \frac{3 \Omega \nu}{2 c_{s}^{2}}
\end{equation}



This means that smaller $\alpha$ corresponds to less viscous disks. 


The thermal timescale, related to the time needed for re-adjustment to the thermal equilibrium (derived in detail in \citealt{frank2002}), is the ratio of heat content per unit disk area to dissipation rate per unit disk area: $(dE / A) / (dE/dt /  A) = dt $.  The heat content per unit volume is ${\sim} \rho k T / \mu m_{p} {\sim} \rho c_{s}^{2}$, and heat content per unit area is  ${\sim} \rho c_{s}^{2} / h {\sim} \Sigma c_{s}^{2}$. Meanwhile, the dissipation rate per unit area, $D(R)$, is 

\begin{equation}
D(R) = \frac{9}{8} \nu \Sigma R^{-3} G M
\end{equation}

(eq. 4.30 in \citealt{frank2002}), so :

\begin{equation}
t_{th} {\sim} \frac{c_{s}^{2}R^{3}}{G M \nu } = \frac{c_{s}^{2}}{\nu \Omega} = \frac{t_{dyn}}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

Thus if the disk were inviscid ($\nu \rightarrow 0$), then $t_{th}\rightarrow\infty$ i.e. there is no contact with adjacent disk elements. 

The cooling and heating fronts propagate through the disk at  $\alpha c_{s} $ \citep{hameury2009}  - in that description  with no viscosity there is no communication between neighboring disk annuli, and thus no front propagation \citep{balbus1998, balbus2003}. Following \cite{stern2018}, if we define as $h/R$  the the disk aspect ratio, with the disk height $h = c_{s} / \Omega$, the characteristic time for front propagation is:

\begin{equation}
t_{front} {\sim} (h/R) ^ {-1} t_{th}
\end{equation}


The viscous timescale is the characteristic time it would take for a parcel of material to undergo a radial transport due to the viscous torques from the radius $R$ to the black hole \citep{czerny2006}. Note that while viscosity has probably magnetic origin \citep{eardley1975, grzedzielski2017}, in this simplistic order of magnitude estimate we use a hydrodynamical description of accretion flow.  With $\nu = \eta / \rho$ (kinematic viscosity being the ratio of dynamical viscosity to density), \cite{frank2002} shows (Chap.5.2) that 

\begin{equation}
t_{visc} {\sim} R^{2} / \nu {\sim}  R / v_{R} = (h/R)^{-2} t_{th}
\end{equation}

 We can parametrize each timescale for a black hole mass $M_{BH} = 10^{8} M_{\odot}$, at $R {\sim} 150 r_{g}$, with the gravitational radius $r_{g} = GM_{BH} / c^{2} {\sim} 4 \mathrm{au}$, using Eqs.5-8 in \cite{stern2018} : 


 \begin{equation}
 t_{dyn} {\sim} 10  \mathrm{days} \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}} \right) 
 \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2} 
 \end{equation}

 \begin{equation}
 t_{th}   {\sim} 1 \,\mathrm{year} \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1}  
 \left( \frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}}\right) \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right)^{3/2} 
 \end{equation}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  t_{front} {\sim} 20 \,\mathrm{years} \left( \frac{h/R}{0.05}\right)^{-1}   \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1}  \nonumber  \\ 
  \left( \frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}}\right)     \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2} 
 \end{eqnarray}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  t_{visc}  {\sim} 400 \, \mathrm{years} \left( \frac{h/R}{0.05}\right)^{-2}   \left( \frac{\alpha}{0.03}\right)^{-1} \nonumber  \\  
  \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^{8} M_{\odot}} \right)     \left( \frac{R}{150 r_{g}}\right) ^{3/2}  
 \end{eqnarray}


In summary,  of  considered timescales only thermal and dynamical are short enough to be related to  the observed short-term stochastic variability. It may be that the variability on the scale of days is driven by local changes, and on the longer scale (perhaps hundreds of days) by a different mechanism \citep{kokubo2015}. The other time scales may be more related to the dramatic changes in brightness of the continuum as observed in changing-look AGN. Indeed, \citet{noda2018} favor a change in mass accretion rate, followed by a propagation of the cooling front \citep{lawrence2018, simm2016}. \citet{noda2018} also suggest that perhaps some short-term variability could be related to the amount of the disk swept by the thermal front propagation due to Hydrogen ionization instability, similarly to white dwarf systems (also, see \citealt{ruan2019, ross2018, sniegowska2019}). 


The variability on several years timescale could also be explained by the X-ray reprocessing model \citep{kokubo2015, kubota2018}, assuming that the AGN UV-optical variability is a result of reprocessing of X-ray or far-UV emission \citep{krolik1991}.  The idea of X-ray reprocessing  over time has gained more and more support, with evidence from simultaneous X-ray-UV-optical AGN time series \citep{edelson2014, mchardy2018,  zhu2018}. In particular, the accretion disk blackbody emission is insufficient to explain the broadband AGN spectrum. The total SED with a soft X-ray excess, and a hard X-ray tail, requires additional sources of emission. A recent model by \citet{kubota2018} divides the flow into blackbody emission, warm Comptonization region (the disk), and hard X-ray hot Comptonization component (corona, or a hot material filling the region close to the black hole below the truncation radius).  Since the soft X-rays are correlated with the hard X-rays, at least part of the picture consists of reflection or reprocessing of hard X-rays by the disk \citep{lawrence2018}. This model predicts an increase of variability amplitude (SF$_{\infty}$) with $M_{BH}$, and adds an insight that the observed slope is due to changes in accretion rate $\dot{m}$, explaining that smaller $\dot{m}$ corresponds to highest variability. This qualitatively agrees with the picture that dwindling fuel supply makes the flow more variable. Previous worries about X-ray reprocessing concerned the seemingly insufficient solid angle subtended by the source of the hard X-rays to cause the observed soft X-ray and optical response. This is addressed by realizing that reprocessing could be taking place in the extended region \citep{gardner2017}, such as an inflated inner disk (corresponding to warm Comptonizing region in \citealt{kubota2018}, or even the BLR region serving as an additional `complex reprocessor'\citep{mchardy2018}. Also, for \citet{panda2019a} warm corona helps decrease the dependence of $R_{\mathrm{Fe  II}}$ on $f_{Edd}$. 

Thus while CLAGN may be related to the state-change to ADAF flow \citep{sniegowska2019}, similar to that of XRBs \citep{noda2018,ruan2019}, with cooling and heating fronts \citep{ross2018}, the short-timescale variability requires approximately three distinct emission regions \citep{kubota2018}, with extended reprocessor (such as diffuse, hot, puffed-up inner disk, and BLR - \citealt{mchardy2018}), that reverberates the rapid hard X-ray variability in soft X-rays to optical via UV \citep{fausnaugh2018}. Some emission (especially soft X-rays) seems to require the warm Comptonizing corona \citep{kubota2018}. The warm corona, coupled with metallicity changes, and variation in turbulence level and cloud density, also helps explain the Quasar Main Sequence in the optical \citep{panda2019a,panda2019b}. Finally, the \citet{kubota2018} model, apart from being consistent with other mechanisms \citep{mchardy2018, panda2019a, sniegowska2019, lawrence2018, ross2018, ruan2019}, explains the observed correlation of variability amplitude with black hole mass as corresponding to variations in mass accretion rate.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We model the optical variability of ${\sim} 9000$ Stripe 82 quasars as the Damped Random Walk (DRW, \citealt{kelly2009}). DRW is a Gaussian Process (GP), described by two parameters - characteristic timescale $\tau$ (representing decorrelation timescale, or light curve smoothness), and the asymptotic amplitude SF$_{\infty}$ (which relates to the amplitude of variability). We fit observed and simulated light curves with \project{celerite} - a fast GP solver \citep{foreman2017}. By simulating and fitting DRW light curves, we explore the impact of the ratio of input timescale and the light curve baseline. We find that the light curve length needs to be several larger than input timescale to allow unbiased timescale retrieval, confirming K17. Motivated by this result we consider extending SDSS with PS1, PTF, CRTS, and ZTF data.  We calculated appropriate photometric offsets (color terms) to relate PS1 gri, PTF gR,  CRTS V, and ZTF r to SDSS r-band. However, due to larger photometric uncertainties of PTF, ZTF ,CRTS at faint magnitudes of SDSS quasars, we decided to use only PS1 r-band data. Furthermore, SDSS r-band and PS1 r-band are sufficiently similar that no photometric transformation is required.  Thus by extending the SDSS r-band light curves with PS1 DR2 r-band data we improve on the fidelity of recovered DRW parameters. 

We identify 38 objects which exhibit tenfold increase in variability timescale when using the SDSS-PS1 dataset as compared to timescale inferred from SDSS alone. Their light curves show characteristics of changing-look quasars (magnitude difference larger than 0.5 mag, \citealt{macleod2016}). Of these, 5 are confirmed in the literature ~\citep{macleod2019, lamassa2015}. We recommend spectroscopic follow-up and further monitoring of the brightest targets (see Appendix~\ref{app:clqso_cands}).

We investigate the correlation of quasar physical properties, such as black hole mass $M_{BH}$ and absolute i-band magnitude $M_{i}$,  with DRW model parameters. The SDSS-PS1 data, coupled with \citet{shen2011} quasar catalog, imply that the damping timescale $\tau$  is correlated with $M_{BH}$ with a power-law index of $0.141 \pm 0.019$, and almost independent of quasar bolometric luminosity, as in M10, \citet{wilhite2008}, and \citet{vandenberk2004}. The asymptotic variability amplitude SF$_{\infty}$ is anti-correlated with luminosity $M_{i}$ with power law index $0.118\pm0.003$, and correlated with $M_{BH}$ with slope $0.118\pm 0.008$. This can be explained if the driving variable was Eddington ratio $f_{Edd}$ \citep{wilhite2008}. Indeed, there is an anti-correlation of SF$_{\infty}$ and $f_{Edd}$, with power law slope of $-0.207 \pm 0.031$ (similar to M10).  As suggested by \citet{kubota2018}, this gradient of SF$_{\infty}$ in the plane of $M_{BH}$ vs $M_{i}$ could be explained if the lower mass accretion rate corresponds to higher variability, so that when the supply of fuel decreases, the flow becomes less stable, more clumpy, and more inhomogeneous ~\citep{rakshit2017, kokubo2015, dexter2011}.  This is also consistent with the X-ray reprocessing model, whereby the hard X-ray variability of the inner disk is reflected/reprocessed by the extended warm Comptonization region (inflated disk), and perhaps a complex reprocessor, including the clouds of the broad line region~\citep{kubota2018, panda2019b}. Changes on recovered timescales are too fast to be driven by changes in disk viscosity, or thermal front propagation alone - thermal or dynamical timescale of response to the changes in X-ray emission seems most consistent with our results ~\citep{stern2018}.


More data extending the light curves would help improve the DRW fit coefficients, potentially decreasing the scatter in observed correlations. Moreover, given that the uncertainty in black hole mass is one of the biggest sources of error, better measurements of quasar properties would be of high utility~\citep{shen2011}.  This will be possible by the upcoming AGN reverberation mapping campaigns (eg. SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper), providing better calibration for line width-based methods of estimating black hole masses~\citep{kollmeier2017}. All quasars in this study were spectroscopically confirmed, but some spectra had low signal-to-noise, resulting in higher likelihood of incorrect redshift measurement. Better spectroscopy and follow up of S82 quasars, afforded by SDSS-V panoptic spectroscopy, would not only help improve on the spectrum-based  properties (redshift, absolute magnitude, black hole masses), but also allow to study spectral changes, and further new CLAGN discoveries~\citep{macleod2019}. 

If this study were to be expanded onto a sample of quasars with good photometry over sufficiently long baselines, but lacking spectral information, the required physical information on quasars could be obtained by indirect methods of estimating the coarse spectral information from broad-band photometry~\citep{kozlowski2015}. This would benefit from better catalogs of existing spectroscopically-confirmed quasars (SDSS DR14) to improve the calibration, as well as better methods of estimating the redshift based on photometry alone (eg. photo-z, \citealt{jin2019,curran2019,yang2017,richards2015}).  This will be possible in short term with the ZTF \citep{bellm2018}, and in the long term with LSST~\citep{ivezic2019}. Occasional coverage adding few epochs to some quasars may be possible with other surveys (eg. TESS, \citealt{ricker2014}), but to improve the statistics of an entire sample of S82 quasars would require longer baselines. Combining SDSS and PS1 with LSST would provide unprecedented 35-year baseline, which assuming timescales below 1000 days is over 10 times longer, allowing unbiased DRW parameter retrieval, which coupled with correlations with quasar properties, would provide an estimate of black hole masses and bolometric luminosities for millions of quasars~\citep{ivezic2019}.

\section{Measuring Quasar properties} 
\label{app:measureBHmass}
In this work we employ black hole masses, bolometric luminosities, and K-corrections from \cite{shen2011} catalog, based on single-epoch SDSS spectra. Here we explain the choices made in the difficult art of estimating each of these quasar physical properties.

It is non-trivial to measure the mass of black holes living in the centers of active galaxies, even provided a detailed spectrum. The most common  approach to estimate black hole masses in AGN is to assume that the broad-line region (BLR) is virialized:


\begin{equation}
M_{BH} = f \frac{ R\Delta V^{2} }{G} = f M_{vir}
\end{equation}


where $f$ is a constant of order unity, $R$ is the size of the BLR (estimated from  emission-line lag $\Delta t$ as $R = c \Delta t$), $\Delta V$ is virial velocity, $G$ gravitational constant \citep{shen2008}.  From reverberation mapping studies (eg. \citealt{shen2018}) we know that continuum luminosity $L$ is related to the size of the BLR region as $R \propto L^{\gamma}$ \citep{vestergaard2006}, with $\gamma$ very close to $1/2$ (eg. \citealt{bentz2009} finds from RM studies $\gamma = 0.519 \pm 0.06$). Thus we find  that $R \Delta V^{2} \propto L^{\gamma} \Delta V^{2} \equiv \mu$. The virial velocity $\Delta V$ is usually estimated from the width of the broad emission lines (or line dispersion).  In the absence of a quasar spectrum, there are alternative methods using a conversion of the broad-band photometry into monochromatic fluxes in the vicinity of reverberating lines (eg. \citealt{kozlowski2015}, used in \citealt{kozlowski2017b} to estimate black hole mass for 280 000 AGN).   
Depending on the redshift, different rest-frame calibrated emission lines shift into the observed passband: broad H$\alpha$ at  $6562\mbox{\AA}$, H$\beta$ at  $5100 \mbox{\AA}$, Mg\,{\sc ii} at $2800\mbox{\AA}$, and C\,{\sc iv} at $1350\mbox{\AA}$ (see Fig.7 in \citealt{shen2018}, and \citealt{vestergaard2002}). Some authors even consider separately C\,{\sc iv}-based and  Mg\,{\sc ii}-based  black hole mass estimates. We refer the reader to \citet{shen2008} who in detail describes various biases and inherent assumptions of virial black hole mass measurements. 



Another important quasar property - bolometric luminosity, is most often estimated from the absolute i-band magnitude, $M_{i}$ (see \citealt{shen2008}, Fig.2). $M_{i}$ is derived from the observed i-band magnitude, by correcting for Galactic extinction, and correcting for the fact that at different redshifts different portions of the spectral energy distribution are observed by the telescope filter bandpass. The latter, known as K-correction $K(z)$ \citep{oke1968},  is defined as $m_{intrinsic} = m_{observed} - K(z)$. In the early 2000`s the common approach was to K-correct to redshift 0, but as \citep{richards2006a} pointed out, since the distribution of quasars peaks at redshift 2, for most quasars correcting to the redshift of 0 required shifting the observed spectrum into the far infrared. Moreover, the procedure was to correct separately for the continuum and emission line contributions, assuming a particular spectral shape (eg. power law  $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=-0.5$ - see \citealt{schneider2010, vandenberk2001, richards2006a}).  This introduces a larger error for K(z=0) than for K(z=2) if the assumed spectral shape $\alpha=-0.5$ is far from the real spectral index. In early 2010`s, after  \citealt{richards2006a, wisotzki2000, blanton2003},  the practice started shifting towards K-correcting to redshift 2,  and including custom qusasar spectral shapes, as reflected by the content of \cite{shen2011} quasar catalog. Thus in this study we use  the absolute i-band magnitude K-corrected to z=2: $M_{i}(z=2)$. % from \citep{shen2011}. 



These methods were used to create catalogs of quasar properties derived from spectra. Since quasars are variable at ${\sim}0.2$ mag level, the ideal is to use a single-epoch calibrated spectrum to estimate the continuum luminosity, and find virial black hole masses using relationships based on the monochromatic fluxes and broad line widths described above. A glance at the available quasar catalogs reveals that, given any SDSS data release, there is indeed first a catalog of basic quasar properties (redshift and photometry - eg. \citealt{schneider2007, schneider2010}), and more detailed catalogs containing black hole masses and bolometric luminosities  follow (eg. \citealt{shen2008, shen2011}). More recently, once SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog \citep{paris2017} was released,  \citealt{kozlowski2017a} followed using SDSS photometry as a proxy for monochromatic luminosities. \citet{chen2018} added a detailed analysis of continuum luminosities in the  H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ regions for low-redshift quasars. Using the spectra from Chinese LAMOST survey \citet{dong2018} also sought to estimate virial black hole masses, and the results, while consistent with \citet{shen2011}, suffered from the necessity to peg the non-calibrated spectra to the SDSS photometry which was taken  a different epoch. Thus even though the SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog of \cite{paris2018}  is the most recent, like \citet{paris2017} it lacks black hole masses and bolometric luminosities, and there is no recent work that re-analyzed the spectral data. Therefore we use black hole mass estimates and monochromatic luminosities from \citet{shen2011}, based directly on single-epoch spectra.

\section{CLQSO candidates}
\label{app:clqso_cands}

Based on the DRW model  parameters $\tau$, $\sigma$ fitted with \project{celerite} using the SDSS and PS1 data, we find that there are quasars for which there is a pronounced difference between $\tau$, $\sigma$  inferred from combined SDSS-PS1 data vs just SDSS. Specifically, Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_tau_ratios} shows that there are objects where 
$f_{\sigma} = \log_{10}{\left( \sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}} \right)} > 0.4 $ and 
 $f_{\tau} = \log_{10}{\left( \tau_{\mathrm{SDSS-PS1}} / \tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}} \right)} > 1  $.  This corresponds to a tenfold increase in $\tau$ and over twofold increase in $\sigma$. Visual inspection of objects simultaneously satisfying $f_{\sigma}> 0.4$ and $f_{\tau}> 1 $ shows that these undergo a significant ($>0.5$ mag) change in brightness between the SDSS (baseline 1998 - 2008) and PS1 DR2 observations (2009-2014 - see Fig.~\ref{fig:lc_extent}). Thus DRW fitting could also be a way of finding changing-look quasar (and AGN) candidates. Figs.~\ref{fig:clqso1}--~\ref{fig:clqso4} show the SDSS-PS1 r-band light curves of 38 CLQSO candidates, with median SDSS part brighter than 20.5 mag. The open circles indicate day-averaged epochs (see Sec.~\ref{sec:data}). Table~\ref{tab:clqso} contains the basic physical parameters for these quasars. Some quasars show a downward trend, like turn-off CLQSO (eg. 123909, 1412379,  1644710), while some are seen in a brightening stage, like turn-on CLQSO (eg. 1976348, 221006, 4069419, 4205621). Quasar 612585 has the largest amount of auxiliary multi-wavelength coverage: x-ray from XMM Newton, UV from Galex, IR from UKIDSS, VHS, WISE, and has been analysed as part of the x-ray targeted sample of S82 quasars - S82X by \cite{lamassa2016a}. Quasar 751557 was previously identified by \cite{macleod2019} as a CLQSO candidate, with detailed Magellan spectroscopy described therein.  Two quasars: 1003694 and 1299803 have WISE data in the S82X catalog \citep{lamassa2016a}. Quasars 612585 and 3633437 have X-ray detections in the 3XMM-DR5 catalog \citep{rosen2016}, but they have no matches in Chandra point source catalog (second release, \citealt{evans2010, evans2018}). There are no matches against the unified radio catalog of \cite{kimball2008}, which includes FIRST and NVSS data. We especially recommend spectroscopic follow-up of the brightest targets: 1976348 (mean 17.8 mag, turn-on, upper-left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:clqso2}), 2104791 (mean 18.4 mag, turn-off, middle-left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:clqso2}).

\section{Mg\,{\sc ii} variability}
\label{app:mgii_variability}
We searched for dependency of variability parameters on other physical properties, beyond the black hole mass and quasar luminosity employed in Eq.~\ref{eq:powlawmodel}. The quasar optical spectrum has certain strong emission lines, depending on the redshift. In particular, the Mg\,{\sc ii} emission line lags the continuum and is less variable \citep{reichert1994}. Mg\,{\sc ii} line  is also an important virial black hole mass estimator for quasars - \cite{mclure2002} noticed that the FWHM of the Mg\,{\sc ii} doublet trails that of the  H$\beta$ line (also see ~\citealt{shen2013}). Following  \cite{ivezic2004} and \cite{macleod2012},  we investigated the residuals in data-model(SF$_{\infty}$) as a function of wavelength. Left hand side panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:mgii} shows the SF$_{\infty}$ residuals in the $\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ vs $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}}$ space. The right hand side panel shows the residuals marginalized along $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}}$. The decrement around 2800 $\mbox{\AA}$ on the right hand side panel is more pronounced when using combined SDSS-PS1 light curves. We see that both aggregates based on raw data (blue dots) or on medians (black dots) agree - the two statistical methods show a small ($\sim5\%$), but statistically significant detection of a depression in the 2800 $\mbox{\AA}$  region, as expected from theory.

The left panel shows the residuals as a function of  $\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}}$. The right panel shows the median of residuals marginalized along $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}}$, with error on the median based on the scatter in $\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ bins : $\sigma_{median} = 1.25 \mathrm{RMS}_{\mathrm{bin}} / \sqrt{N_{\mathrm{bin}}}$, where $\mathrm{RMS}_{\mathrm{bin}}$ is estimated from the robust Gaussian interquartile-based $\sigma_{G}$ \citep{ivezic2014}. Black circles are medians based on the averages plotted on the left ($N_{\mathrm{bin}}$ is between 7 and 20, depending on the number of bins on the left hand side panel that are not empty), and blue dots are medians based on the raw data ($N_{\mathrm{bin}}$ varies as a function of  $\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$, from a few to 800, peaking at about 2500 $\mbox{\AA}$, reflecting the fact that the quasar distribution peaks at redshift $z=2$).  We overplot the composite quasar spectrum from \cite{vandenberk2001}.}
