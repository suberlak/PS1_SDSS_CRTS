\section{Introduction}

Quasars are inherently variable sources at the rms level of 0.2 mag. They are distant active galactic nuclei, harboring a supermassive black hole surrounded by a hot accretion disk. Although it is agreed upon that majority of optical emission stems from the accretion disk, the detailed origin of variability has been debated over the past 50 years. Some favor a thermal origin of variability \citep{kelly2013}, related to the propagation of inhomogeneities ("hot spots") in the disk \citep{dexter2011}, others suggested magnetically elevated disks \citep{dexter2019}, or X-ray reprocessing  \citep{kubota2018}.   Quasar light curves have been successfully described using the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model \citep{kelly2009, macleod2010, kozlowski2010, zu2011, kasliwal2015a}, and the DRW parameters have been linked to the physical quasar properties. \citet{macleod2010} (M10) found correlations of the characteristic timescale and variability amplitude  to the black hole mass, and quasar luminosity.

Variability is also a classification tool, allowing to distinguish quasars from other variable sources that do not exhibit such stochastic variability pattern \citep{macleod2011}. Using the DRW parametrization, \citep{macleod2011} found that DRW timescale and amplitude for QSO are order of  magnitude different from stars. This is especially useful for selecting quasars in the intermediate redshift range (which overlaps the stellar locus in color-color diagrams - see \citealt{sesar2007, yang2017}). Variability has also been used to increase the completeness in measurements of Quasar Luminosity Function (see \citealt{ ross2013, palanque2013, alsayyad2016, mcgreer2013, mcgreer2018}). 

Due to its stochastic nature, the DRW process requires the light curve to be many times longer than the characteristic timescale for an unbiased parameter retrieval. The rule of thumb is that the light curve must be at least ten times longer than its characteristic timescale \citep{kozlowski2010, kozlowski2017a}. For this reason some studies have restricted the probed redshift range, limiting the quasar sample to where one would expect only shorter timescales based on previous studies \citep{sun2018, guo2017}. Others have suffered from short-baseline biases by employing single-survey data \citep{hernitschek2016}.
Thus by extending available quasar light curves we are able to better recover a wider range of DRW timescales, and probe a wider range of redshifts and black hole masses. 


Almost a decade ago \citet{macleod2010} (hereafter M10) published their research using the SDSS Stripe 82 data, and new datasets (PS1,PTF,CRTS) have become available since that can extend the quasar light curves by almost 50\% .  Indeed, \citep{li2018} combined SDSS and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data, to provide a 15 year baseline, but by focusing on a large area to encompass as many quasars as possible (119,305 up to z=4.89)  suffered from having to employ an ensemble approach (SF) rather than the direct light curve modelling due to poor sampling.   On the other hand, \citep{sanchez2018} who employed optical data from QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey, also used the Structure Function parametrization (amplitude of variability and the excess variance), because the light curve length (less than 5 years for 2435 quasars)  excluded the possibility of unbiased retrieval of characteristic timescale. 


 This paper improves on the DRW parameters (Section ~\ref{sec:methods} ) describing amplitude and characteristic timescale of Stripe82 quasars by extending the SDSS light curves for well-sampled Stripe82 with PanStarrs1 (PS1) data (Section ~\ref{sec:data,sec:simulation}). We revisit trends between  the DRW parameters and physical quasar properties, such as black hole mass, or bolometric luminosity (Section ~\ref{sec:results}). We make predictions for fidelity of DRW parameter retrieval once ZTF and LSST data become available. 



\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{DRW as a Gaussian Process}
DRW (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process) can be understood as a member of a class of Gaussian Processes (GP). Each GP is described by a kernel - a covariance function that contains a measure of correlation between two points $x_{n}$, $x_{m}$, separted by $\Delta t_{nm}$. For the  DRW process, the kernel is 

\begin{eqnarray}
k(\Delta t_{nm}) &=& a \exp{(-\Delta t_{tm} / \tau)} \\
                 &=& \sigma^{2}\exp{(-\Delta t_{tm} / \tau)}  \\
                 &=& \sigma^{2} ACF(\Delta t_{tm})
\end{eqnarray} 

Here $a$ or $\sigma^{2}$ is an amplitude of correlation decay as a function of $t_{tm}$,  while $\tau$ is the characteristic timescale over which correlation drops by $1/e$. For a DRW,  the correlation function $k(\Delta t_{nm})$ is also related to the autocorrelation function $ACF$. 

Related to $k(\Delta t_{nm})$ is the   structure function of the DRW process (see \citet{macleod2012, bauer2009, graham2015a} for an overview) , which expresses the rms of  magnitude differences $\Delta m$ as a function of temporal separation $\Delta t$, is : 

\begin{equation}
SF(\Delta t) = SF_{\infty} (1-\exp{(-|\Delta t|/\tau)})^{1/2}
\end{equation}

where $SF_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic value of $SF$ for large time lags. It is known that for QSOs SF follows approximately power law, $SF \propto \Delta t^{\beta}$,  and it levels out for large $\Delta t$) (see \citet{macleod2012}).  Note that $SF_\infty = \sqrt{2} \sigma$  in the above. 


To estimate the  DRW  parameters and fit simulated or real data we employ Celerite - a new fast GP modelling tool\citep{foreman2017}. Combined with the DRW kernel this is similar to the method used by \citet{rybicki1992, kozlowski2010}, M10 - like in previous work, we use a  prior on $\sigma$ and $\tau$ uniform in log space.  The main difference is that rather than adopting the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) as the 'best-fit' value for sought parameters,  we find the expectation value of the marginalized log posterior. If the posterior space was a 2D Gaussian in $\sigma$, $\tau$ space, the expectation value would coincide with the maximum of the log posterior. However, due to non-Gaussian shape of the log posterior, we find that the expectation value is a better   estimate of $\sigma$ and $\tau$  rather than MAP. 

\subsection{The impact of light curve baseline}\label{sec:baseline}

\cite{kozlowski2017a}  reports that one cannot trust any results of DRW fitting unless the light curve length is at least ten times longer than the characteristic timescale. We confirm these generic trends by repeating his simulation setup. We  model 10 000  DRW light curves with fixed length (baseline) $t_{exp}=8$ years, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag,  sampling over a range of input timescales. With a fixed baseline, we are thus exploring a range of $\rho$: the ratio of timescale to baseline ($\rho = \tau / t_{exp}$, $\rho \in   \{ 0.01 : 15\}$). Fig.~\ref each of  100 distinct values of $\rho$ we perform 100 light curve realizations, thus  

\begin{figure*}
\plottwo{figs/SDSS_Jeff1_expectation.png}{figs/OGLE_Jeff1_expectation.png}
\caption{Probing the parameter space of $\rho = \tau / t_{exp}$, with a simulation of  10 000 light curves : 100 light curves per each of 100 $\rho$ values spaced uniformly in logarithmic space between $\rho \in   \{ 0.01 : 15\}$ . Thus with the baseline $t_{exp}$ set to 8 years,  we sample a range of 100 input timescales, as in \citet{kozlowski2017a}. Left panel shows the SDSS-like cadence with N=60 points, and the right panel OGLE-like cadence with N=445 points. The dotted horizontal and solid vertical lines represent $\rho = 0.1$, i.e. the baseline is ten times longer than considered timescale. The diagonal line is $y=x$, i.e. the line that would be followed if the recovered  $\rho$ ($\tau$) was exactly the same as the input $\rho$ ($\tau$).} 
\label{fig:rho_space}
\end{figure*}

To simulate observational conditions  we add to the true underlying signal  $s(t)$ a noise offset, $n(t)$.  Like \cite{kozlowski2017a},  we assume $n(t)$ to be drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma(t))$ with a width $\sigma(t)$ , corresponding to the  photometric uncertainty at the given epoch,  $e(t)$) : 

\begin{equation}
y(t) = s(t) + n(t) 
\end{equation}

The $s(t)$ is found by iterating over the array of time steps $t$.  At each step, we draw a point from a Gaussian distribution, for which the mean and standard deviation are re-calculated at each timestep. Starting at $t_{0}$, the signal is equal to the mean magnitude, $s_{0} = m$. After a timestep $\Delta t_{i} = t_{i+1} - t_{i}$, the signal $s_{i+1}$ is drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(loc, stdev)$, with : 

\begin{equation}
loc = s_{i} e ^ { - r  }  + m \left( 1 - e ^{ - r }\right)
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
stdev^{2} =  0.5  \, \mathrm{SF}_{\infty}^{2} \left( 1 - e ^{  - 2 r  }  \right)
\end{equation}

where  $r = \Delta t_{i} / \tau$, $\tau$ is the damping timescale,   $SF_{\infty}$ is the  variability amplitude , and $m$ the mean magnitude.  This follows the formalizm in \cite{kelly2009} (eqs. A4 and A5) as well as in \cite{macleod2010} (Sec. 2.2 ), and is equivalent to the setup of  \cite{kozlowski2017a}. 


We adopt SDSS S82-like cadence with N=60 epochs, or OGLE-III like cadence with N=445 epochs.  The errors were set by the adopted mean magnitudes, $r=17$ and $I=18$ , as in \cite{kozlowski2017a} :

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{SDSS}^{2} &=& 0.013^{2} + \exp{(2 (r-23.36))} \\
\sigma_{OGLE}^{2} &=& 0.004^{2} + \exp{(1.63 (I - 22.55))}
\end{eqnarray}



Fig~\ref{fig:rho_space} shows that as stipulated in \cite{kozlowski2017a},  the recovered $\rho$ becomes meaningless ('unconstrained') if the available baseline is not at least ten times longer than the underlying timescale. It also means that by extending the baseline we can move from the biased region to the unbiased regime.  Encouraged by this result, we extend the baselines of  quasar light curves, and revisit relations studied by  M10 and \cite{hernitschek2016}. 

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}
\subsection{Surveys}
We focus on data pertaining to a 290 deg$^{2}$ region of southern sky, repeatedly observed by the SDSS between 1998 and 2008. Originally aimed at supernova discovery, objects in this area, known as Stripe82 (S82), were  re-observed on average 60 times (see \citealt{macleod2012} Sec. 2.2 for overview, and \citealt{annis2014} for details ) . Availability of well-calibrated \citep{ivezic2007}, long-baseline light curves spurred variability research (see \citealt{sesar2007}). The catalog prepared by \citep{schneider2008} as part of DR9  contains 9258 spectroscopically confirmed quasars.  

\begin{figure}%[ht!]

\end{figure} 

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/lightcurves_extent.png}
\caption{An illustration of survey baseline, sky area covered, and depth. The width of each rectangle corresponds to the extent of light curves available (or simulated) for Stripe 82 quasars for each survey. For SDSS this means DR7; for CRTS DR2, PS1 DR2, PTF DR2, ZTF year 2018, and LSST the full 10-year survey. The lower edge of each rectangle corresponds to the $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude (SDSS r, PS1 r, PTF R, ZTF r, LSST r, CRTS V). The vertical extent corresponds to the total survey area (for SDSS, up to and including DR15).  Note how PS1 and PTF extend the baseline of SDSS by approximately $50\%$, and how inclusion of LSST triples the SDSS baseline. For reference, the area covered by LSST is $25 000$ sq.deg., which corresponds to  $60\%$ of the sky. The whole sky has an area of $4\pi$ steradians (41253 sq.deg.).}
\label{fig:lcExtent}
\end{figure*} 


We extend the SDSS  light curves with PanSTARRS (PS1) \citep{chambers2011,flewelling2018}, CRTS \citep{drake2009}, and PTF \citep{rau2009}. We find 9248 PS1 matches, 6455 PTF matches, and 7737 CRTS matches to SDSS S82 quasars. There are  6444 quasars with SDSS-PS1-PTF-CRTS data.  Fig.~\ref{fig:rawBaselines}  shows the distribution of raw epochs, and Fig~\ref{fig:lcExtent} the  baseline coverage of various surveys.    Each survey uses a unique set of bandpasses and cadences : SDSS light curves contain near-simultaneous $\{u,g,r,i,z\}_{SDSS}$ , and the other are  non-simultaneous : $\{g,r,i,z,y\}_{PS1}$ ,  $\{g,R\}_{PTF}$, $V_{CRTS}$.  

\subsection{Photometric offsets}

To utilize all data we define a common 'target' bandpass. SDSS r band is closest to PS1 r, PTFr, CRTSV. For this reason we translate photometry from nearby filters ($\{g,R\}_{PTF}$, $\{g,r,i\}_{PS1}$, $V_{CRTS}$) to the  'master' $r_{SDSS}$  band.

With two photometric systems, eg. SDSS(ugriz), and PS1(grizy),  we can find offsets (or color terms) from one to another. Consider SDSS as target system,  PS1 as the auxiliary system, so that we find offsets from PS1 to SDSS. This amounts to creating 'synthetic' SDSS bands from PS1, using the SDSS color to spread the stellar locus. More generally, we would always use the color of the target system : 

\begin{equation}
r_{PS1} -  r_{SDSS} = f ( SDSS (g-i ))
\end{equation}

the function is a polynomial fitted to the stellar locus on the plot of $SDSS (g-i )$ vs $r_{PS1} -  r_{SDSS} $. We use $SDSS(g-i)$ because is provides a larger wavelength baseline than $(g-r)$. 

Note that there are other possible choices for the target band and the intermediate color to spread the stellar locus. For instance, rewriting the above as  $m - s = f(x)$, \cite{tonry2012} derived offsets from SDSS to PS1  using $x$ = SDSS($g-r$), $m = PS1 \{g,r,i,z,y\}$, and $s$ = SDSS($r$).

Since quasars occupy a blue region in the color-color diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:quasarColors}), we calculate photometric offsets specifically for this region of the spectrum.  We only show the color-magnitude diagrams  for PS1 offsets  (Fig. ~\ref{fig:offsetsPS1}) since we choose not to include CRTS and PTF data in the final sample.

The offsets used to make combined r-band light curves are shown in Table ~\ref{tab:offsets}

For these stars we  obtained PS1 photometry from MAST \url{http://panstarrs.stsci.edu} and PTF from IRSA PTF Object Catalog \url{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/}. We further imposed quality cuts requiring that the stars are bright: $r < 19$.}

%NOTE ABOUT EXTINCTION:  due to dust present between us and the standard stars (or background quasars), the observed light will appear slightly redder because dust preferentially scatters blue light away. This depends on the location of the source on the  sky and is related to the dust inhomogeneities in the Milky Way. 

%However, in deriving bandpass to bandpass transformation all that matters is the flux received at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), for which all photometry is corrected at the pipeline processing level (both for SDSS,  PTF, PS1, and CRTS). In other words, all that matters is that any SED at TOA will have slightly different magnitude (hence colors) depending on whether we observe it with SDSS(r),  PS1(r), or PTF(R).  Therefore, to derive photometric offsets (which are time-independent), we use Sloan colors not corrected for extincton (and likewise, PS1, PTF, etc.) .  

%Correction for insterstellar extinction is only needed for color selection, since otherwise objects would appear to be of the later stellar type (redder) than they really are. To correct for extinction we use the most up-to-date maps of stellar extinction Bayestar17 (Green+2018). These extinction maps are 3D probabilistic, and we assume a uniform distance of 4 kpc for the dust column for all stars.  


\section{Simulation : lessons learned}\label{sec:simulation}

Having established in Sec.~\ref{sec:baseline} that extending the light curve baseline improves the recovery of input DRW parameters,  we combine SDSS light curves with PS1 data. We first consider the theoretical improvement in the fit, simulating DRW light curves for which we select SDSS-PS1 , or SDSS-only sections.  Then we fit the real data with DRW model, and divide by (1+z) to study the timescales in rest frame. 


We simulate the DRW using the real cadences and errors corresponding to sections of combined light curves (SDSS,PS1,CRTS,PTF), including the portion corresponding to the predicted LSST and ZTF contribution.  For LSST segment we assumed a cadence of 50 epochs per year,  for 10 years (between 2023-2033), and  magnitude-dependent photometric uncertainty from Sec. 3.5 in \citet{lsstscibook}:

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{LSST}(m)^{2} = \sigma_{sys}^{2} + \sigma_{rand}^{2} \,\, \mathrm{(mag)}^{2}\\
\sigma_{rand}^{2} = (0.04-\gamma)x + \gamma x^{2} \\
x = 10^{0.4(m-m_{5})}
\end{eqnarray}

with  $\sigma_{sys} = 0.005$, $\gamma=0.039$, $m_{5} = 24.7$ (see Table 3.2  therein).


For the ZTF segment (the 2018 data that covers Stripe82, to be released May 9 2019), we have assumed 120 observations in ZTFg and ZTFr, every three days, with error structure derived from ZTF light curves. We fitted the functional form described above to estimate the ZTF photometric uncertainty (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ztf_errors})



\begin{figure*}%[ht!]
\plotone{figs/ZTF_error_curve.png}
\caption{The rms spread as a function of magnitude for ZTF objects with over 100 observations. We overplot the functional describing the adopted error model. Properties of ZTF photometric uncertainty are largely similar to the PTF uncertainties.}
\label{fig:ztf_errors}
\end{figure*} 


For all light curves we assumed  $\tau = 575 $ days, $SF_{\infty} = 0.2$ mag (the median of S82 distribution in ~\citet{macleod2010}). Fig.~\ref{fig:simLC} shows an example simulated DRW for SDSS-PS1-LSST.

\begin{figure*}%[ht!]
\plotone{figs/1072282_w_LSST1.png}
\caption{Simulated DRW process sampled at real cadence of SDSS, PS1, and simulated cadence of LSST. To each observed  point we add Gaussian noise corresponding to the reported  heteroscedastic (different for all points) errors for SDSS-PS1, and simulated magnitude-dependent errors for LSST. }
\label{fig:simLC}
\end{figure*} 

To the simulated true DRW signal we add Gaussian noise corresponding to epochal heteroscedastic errors (eg. for SDSS epochs we use SDSS errors, for PS1 epochs we use PS1 errors, etc). This noise causes the underlying signal to become less constrained for larger errors (eg. CRTS  and PTF portion).  We further found that inclusion of ZTF data for 2018 would not significantly change our results. Inclusion of PS1 data with its excellent photometric uncertainty (as compared to ZTF or PTF) is the best improvement over existing SDSS results.  We predict that in the future (after more data has been assembled and re-calibrated) ZTF will help, but not as dramatically as LSST (see Fig.~\ref{fig:simLCresults1}).  For this reason we found that using only SDSS-PS1 portion is the best tradeoff between adding more baseline vs introducing more uncertainty by noisy simulation  - see Fig.~\ref{fig:combinedLCerrors} for error distribution, and Fig.~\ref{fig:simLC} for illustration of  the simulated light curve. 

\begin{figure}%[ht!]
\plotone{figs/real_combined-r_band_sdss_ps1_stats.png}
\caption{Distribution of median errors in combined r-band real light curves. We calculate the median per segment. This shows that the CRTS and PTF portions have much larger errors than SDSS, PS1, and are therefore less useful in improving the DRW parameters. This is the reason for using only SDSS-PS1 portion.  }
\label{fig:combinedLCerrors}
\end{figure} 


In accordance with Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_space}, we find that extending the baseline decreases the bias in retrieved DRW parameters. Indeed, Fig.~\ref{fig:simLCresults1} shows that for an ensemble of 6444 simulated light curves the  recovered DRW parameters become less biased when supplementing the SDSS data with PS1. , and th and ~\ref{fig:simLCresults2}

\section{Results: fitting SDSS-PS1 with Celerite}\label{sec:results}

We have extended the baseline of Stripe82 quasars by adding to SDSS r-band data the  PS1 g,r,i data, transformed into common SDSS r-band. Encouraged by the simulation results we first show that the fitting routine is consistent when using only SDSS r-band portion with the results obtained by M10. Since the variability is assumed to be intrinsic to quasars, we shift timescales to rest frame : $\tau_{\mathrm{RF}} = \tau_{\mathrm{OBS}} / (1+z)$.  First, fits for DRW parameters using only the SDSS segment of quasar light curves ($\tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}}$, $SF_{\infty, \mathrm{SDSS}}$) are consistent with M10 : Fig.~\ref{fig:tauRF_SFinf}  shows that the distributions  $\tau_{RF}$ and $SF_{\infty}$ overlap. Furthermore, Fig.~\ref{fig:celeriteCompare} compares DRW parameters using only the SDSS segment for M10 and this work, plotting the ratio of M10 results to $\sigma_{\mathrm{SDSS}}$, $\tau_{\mathrm{SDSS}}$. Both histograms are peaked close to 0 which would indicate perfect agreement.

\subsection{Trends with Rest-frame Wavelength}

Following  \citet{macleod2011} , we shift all timescales to rest-frame, and prior to looking for correlations with physical quantities (black hole mass, luminosities, redshifts), we correct all quantities to rest frame wavelength of $4000 \AA $. This is because originally the SDSS data employed by  \citet{macleod2011}  were taken in near-simultaneous ugriz filters, each centered on different observers wavelength. Because quasars are not all at the same distance, this means that the same band would probe a different rest-frame wavelength for each quasar.   \citet{macleod2011}  found that $\tau_{RF}$ and $SF_{\infty}$  ($f$) can be connected to rest-frame wavelength $\lambda_{RF}$ via power law  :  

\begin{equation}
f \propto \left( \frac{\lambda_{RF}}{4000 \AA} \right)^{B}
\end{equation}

Fig.~\ref{fig:wavelength_dependence}  shows that both using SDSS and SDSS-PS1 the timescales and asymptotic amplitudes follow approximate power law coefficients found by \citet{macleod2011}.

In all datasets the quasars were selected according to criteria of \citet{macleod2011}. The red line indicates the best-fit power law to \citet{macleod2011} data, with $B=0.17$ an $-0.479$ for $\tau_{RF}$, and $SF_{\infty}$, respectively.}

\end{figure*} 


\subsection{Trends with Luminosity, Black Hole Mass, and Redshift}

Here we examine the main scientific results : the correlations between variability parameters  ($\tau, SF{\infty}$), and the physical properties of quasars (rest-frame wavelength $\lambda_{RF}$, redshift $z$, absolute i-band magnitude $M_{i}$, and black hole mass $M_{BH}$). 

First, we consider the selection effects that are inherent to the quasar distribution. Fig.~\ref{fig:quasar_properties} shows the distribution of quasars as a function of redshift $z$, i magnitude $M_{i}$, and black hole mass $M_{BH}$. For instance, the trend of increasing redshift with $M_{i}$ on the upper left panel is due to the fact that quasars have to be brighter to be included in the survey at increasing distances. 



As explained in \citep{shen2008,shen2011}, the most common approach to estimate quasar black hole mass is to assume that the broad-line region (BLR) is virialized, so that the continuum luminosity can be used as a proxy for the BLR radius, and the width of the broad emission lines (or line dispersion) is used to compute the virial velocity. The most commonly used, calibrated emission lines, that are available across different redshifts, are broad H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, Mg\,{\sc ii}, and C\,{\sc iv} \citep{vestergaard2002}. 
There are various available catalogs of quasar properties : redshift, absolute i-band luminosity, black hole mass.  Usually the first quasar catalog releases basic properties such as redshift and photometry (eg. \citealt{schneider2007, schneider2010}, and then more involved studies derive black hole masses and bolometric luminosities (eg. \citealt{shen2008, shen2011}). This is also the case for more recent work:  once \citep{paris2017} released SDSS DR12 Quasar Catalog (DR12Q),  \citep{kozlowski2017a} followed by estimating from photometry the monochromatic luminosities,  and  deriving black hole masses, and \citep{chen2018} added a detailed analysis of continuum luminosities in the  H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ regions for low-redshift quasars. Using the spectra from Chinese LAMOST survey \citep{dong2018} also sought to estimate virial black hole masses, and the results while consistent with \citep{shen2011}, suffered from necessity to peg the non-calibrated spectra to SDSS photometry which was taken at a different epoch.  For sources variable at \~0.2 mag level, such as quasars, the ideal is to use single-epoch calibrated spectra to estimate continuum luminosity, and find virial black hole masses using relationships based on the monochromatic fluxes and broad line widths. Even though \cite{paris2018} DR14Q is the most recent catalog, like \citep{paris2017} it lacks black hole masses and bolometric luminosities, and \citep{kozlowski2017a}  bases his analysis on a SDSS photometry as a proxy for monochromatic luminosities rather than directly from the spectra. Of all available catalogs,  \citep{shen2011} provides the best to date measurements of quasar black hole masses and monochromatic luminosities, based directly on the single-epoch spectra, and is therefore our choice. 




The absolute i-band magnitude $M_{i}$ is a good proxy for the bolometric luminosity (see \citealt{shen2008}, Fig.2). $M_{i}$ is derived from the observed i-band magnitude, by correcting for Galactic extinction, and K-correcting for the fact that at different redshifts different portions of the spectral energy distribution are observed by the telescope filter bandpass. Historically termed K-correction \citep{oke1968}, $K(z)$ is defined as $m_{intrinsic} = m_{observed} - K(z)$. In the early 2000s the standard was to K-correct to redshift 0, but as \citep{richards2006a} pointed out, since the distribution of quasars peaks at redshift 2, for most quasars K(z=0) required shifting the observed spectrum into the far infrared. The procedure was to correct separately for the continuum and emission line contributions, assuming a particular spectral shape (eg. power law  $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=-0.5$ - see \citealt{schneider2010, vandenberk2001, richards2006a}). This introduced large error if the assumed spectral shape $\alpha=-0.5$ was far from the real spectral index. In early 2010s the standard started to shift towards K-correcting to redshift 2 (following  \citealt{richards2006a, wisotzki2000, blanton2003}), and including custom qusasar spectral shapes, as we see eg. in the catalog of \citep{shen2011}. Thus in this study we use  the absolute i-band magnitude K-corrected to z=2: $M_{i}(z=2)$ from \citep{shen2011}. 





\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/macleod2010_Fig12_Shen2011.png}
\caption{Distribution of quasars as a function of  redshift, observed i-band magnitude, absolute i-band magnitude (K-corrected to z=2), and virial black hole mass. All quantities from \citep{shen2011}. }
\label{fig:quasar_properties}
\end{figure*} 


We show on  Fig.~\ref{fig:sf_tau_bh_mass_luminosity} $\tau$ and $SF_{\infty}$ as a function of absolute magnitude $M_{i}$, redshift z, and black hole mass $M_{BH}$. 



\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/macleod2010_Fig14_Shen2011_sdss-ps1.png}
\caption{Long-term variability ($SF_{\infty}$), and characteristic timescale ($\tau$), as a function of absolute i-band magnitude (K-corrected to redshift 2, proxy for bolometric luminosity), virial black hole mass, and redshift. }
\label{fig:sf_tau_bh_mass_luminosity}
\end{figure*} 


We investigate these correlations by fitting a power law, after \citet{macleod2011} :


\begin{eqnarray}
\log_{10}{f} = &A& + B \log_{10}\left( \lambda_{RF} / 4000 \AA \right) + C (M_{i} + 23) \nonumber \\
&+& D \log_{10}{\left( M_{BH} / 10^{9} M_{\odot}  \right)} 
\end{eqnarray} 

where $f$ is $\tau_{RF}$ or $SF_{\infty}$. 


 \citet{macleod2011}  used the Shen2008 catalog, and k-corrected the absolute i-band magnitude to a redshift of 0. Since then, given that the redshift distribution of quasars peaks at z=2, it has become a more standard practice to k-correct absolute quasar magnitudes to z=2, as it is in Shen2011 catalog. We opt to use Shen2011 catalog as a source of physical quasar parameters. 


Since  \citet{macleod2011} used independently fitted each of five SDSS bands, the coefficients A,C,D,E were band-averaged. The result of that, using the new data of Shen2011, is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodShen2011}



\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/Chelsea_ugriz_Shen2011.png}
\caption{Samples from posterior MCMC draws for fit coefficients A,C,D (setting E=0), using Shen2011 values for redshift, absolute i-band magnitide, black hole mass. The vertical dashed line marks the band-averaged values for fit coefficients.  }
\label{fig:MacLeodShen2011}
\end{figure*} 



Since we used SDSS-PS1 combined r-band data, we compare the new DRW parameters to results of fitting \citet{macleod2011}  r-band data (green line from Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodShen2011}). 


The comparison of new results against old ones is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011sf} and ~\ref{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011tau} 



\begin{figure*}
\plotone{figs/posterior_IDL_Chelsea_Celerite_CD_MI_Z2_tau.png}
\caption{Comparison of Celerite fits of SDSS, SDSS-PS1 portions of combined quasar light curves against \citet{macleod2011} results of SDSS r-band only. The results from SDSS-only portion are consistent with previous results, and inclusion of the PS1 portion that increases the baseline decreases the timescale dependence on black hole mass, but increases the luminosity dependence. This can be understood as a rotation of the plane in ($\tau$, $M_{i}$, $M_{BH}$) coordinates.  }
\label{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011tau}

\begin{figure*}

\label{fig:MacLeodCeleriteShen2011sf}
\end{figure*} 


Since the simulations showed that we do decrease the bias by extending the  baseline, we use the combined SDSS-PS1  light curves and show the space occupied by quasars in $SF_{\infty} - \tau - \sigma$ space, which confirms the results of \citet{macleod2011} (Fig.~\ref{fig:realLCresults})
